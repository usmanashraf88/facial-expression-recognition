Oh! That's why. I'm sorry!,0
"OK, try this salmon mousse.",1
Mmmm. Good.,1
Is it better than the other salmon mousse?,1
It's creamier.,4
"Yeah, well, is that better?",3
"I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?",1
My God! What happened to you?,2
"Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn? ""You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation.""",3
That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!,1
"Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!",1
"Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.",4
"Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.",3
It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.,1
Well.... it is amouz-ing...,1
"Hello? Oh, hi Wendy! Yeah, eight o'clock. What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... OK, great. All right, I'll see you then. Bye.",1
Ten dollars an hour for what?,0

"But, but?",3
"But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress.",3
Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.,3
"You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76. Amouz-bouche?",1
Talk to me.,0

Yes indeedy! With a beautiful view of...,1
Oh look! That guy's peeing!,1
"OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down.",1
OK.,0
"This is great! Helen, could you come in here for a moment?",5
"Thank you Helen, that'll be all.",0
"Last time I do that, I promise.",3
"Wendy, we had a deal! Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!",3
Who was that?,0
Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.,3
Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye.,0

Twelve dollars an hour.,0
"Mon. I wish I could, but I've 3e plans to walk around.",0
"You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... twenty dollars an hour.",2
Done.,0
What a tool!,3
You don't want to work for a guy like that.,5
Yeah!,5
"I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it.",6
"Look, you'll get there. You're an amazing chef.",5
Yeah! You know all those yummy noises? I wasn't faking.,1
"So, er... how did it go with Celia?",2
"Oh, I was unbelievable.",5
"All right, Ross!",5
"I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard. I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif... at one point there were villagers.",1
Whoa! And the... huh-huh?,1
"Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh...",2
You cuddled.,1
"Yeah, which was nice.",1
You guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something?,0
"Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?",0
"Yeah, where the hell is he?",2
How's this?,0
Eeeee!,1
Sorry. How about over here?,0
Aaaaah!,1
"See, that just means it's working. Does this hurt?",0
No.,0
What about this?,0
Aaaaahhh!!,3
There you go!,0
I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr. Peanut than Mr. Salty.,3
"No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.",4
"I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.",4
Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!,1
I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!,3
"Oh, that is so sick.",2
I feel violated. And not in a good way.,2
"How can people do that?... Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!",3
Wow... Wow!,1
Yeah.,0
"I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that.",2
"Nooo, it wasn't.",0
"Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here...",4
"Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. Bye-bye. Oh God!",2
That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!,0
"Hey, I've been honing!",0
What was with the dishes?,0
"Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.",0
"Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!",0
Oh my God! Go away! Stop looking in here!,3
"Great, now he's waving back.",0
"Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!",2
What kinda stuff?,0
"Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.",0
You cook naked?,0
"Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.",0
What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.,0
What's the matter?,2
"Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good.",6
"No, it was. It was very very good.",1
"Well, what about Mindy?",0
"Oh, way, way better than Mindy.",4
"No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?",1
"Well, if you want, I'll justI'll just break it off with her.",2
"No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.",2
"Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.",0
"Thanks, Bernice. Let's go away this weekend.",5
"Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..",2
"We can, we can go to Aruba! When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice. You would've liked it.",1
I had a bra.,0
"Hey, Dr. Farber.",0
"All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're starting to see some real progress here.",0
What?!,0
"I'm twelve, I'm not stupid.",3
Brrrrrrr!,0
Hell is filled with people like you.,3
He's back! The peeper's back!,2
Get down!,2
Get down?,2
...And boogie!,2
"Thanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy.",0
"Relax. Y'know, she may not even know.",2
"Please. I haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me? I mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! We went to camp together... she taught me how to kiss..",1
Yeah?,0
"And now, y'know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so..",6
..Naughty!,1
"Right, I'll see you guys later...",0
"Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?",0
Why don't you just take it with you?,0
"Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?",2
Why don't you just call her?,0
"I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride.",2
Do you?,0

"I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!",3
Just like you told her you did! ... Just pointing out the irony.,1
"Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?",0

"Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody.",1
Hi. Hi.,0
What are you doing here?,0
"Well, I've been calling you, but it turns out I had your number wrong. And when I finally got the right one from Information, there was no answer. So I thought I'd just come down here, and make sure you were okay.",0
"...I'm, I'm okay.",0
"Listen uh, maybe we could get together later?",0
"That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...",0

"Well, there's my favorite client. So tell me darling, how was the audition?",1

"Well, the part's mine if I want it.",1
Oh my God!,1
"Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady.",0
Oh my... God?,2
"Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, Days of Our Lives. That's actually on television.",6
"So, what're you gonna do?",0
"Well, I guess I could sleep with her... I mean, how could I do that?",6
I've never slept with someone for a part.,6
Well is she...,0
Sorry.,0
It's alright. Is she good-looking?,4
"Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast. You know, after having slept with her.",1
"Y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas.",1
"I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean, let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General.",2
Didn't you used to call it the Little Major?,4
"Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it.",4
Can I get you something from the bar?,0
"Yes, I would like something. No, no thank you.",6
"No, no really. I.. I wouldn't feel right about it. Just some water.",6
So the light went out in my refrigerator...,0

I'm not breaking up with her!,4
"God, look what I found in the drain.",2

"Ooh. Oh. It looks like, like a tiny little person drowning in your cereal.",0
"God, what is wrong with me.",6
You need to get some sleep.,0
I need to get some Richard.,6

"Look, what do you want me to say?",0
I want you to say that you like her!,3
"I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her.",3
"Thanks for trying. Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!",3
"Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain?",3
How could you have told her?,2
"Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal.",3
"Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal.",3
"Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?",2
"Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us.",3
"That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Who did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'.",3
Were both of those Joey?,0
Not even with your best friend.,0
Noo!,3
"Hmph. So what you, you tell each other everything?",2

"Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol.",1
"I know, but it's still worth mentioning, I think.",2
"Relax every muscle in your body. Listen to the plinky-plunky music. Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place. Okay, tell me your happy place.",5
"Richard's living room, drinking wine.",1
"All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And get out!",2
"I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.",5
"All right, I'll try not to.",2
"Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky....",4
Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?,2
"All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....",4
"I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.",5
"Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.",5
"So, I hear, you hate me!",3
"I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.",2
A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me.,3
And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...,2
"All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, We've got to do something about our little situation here Joey. So, this is my idea you and me spending some quality time together.",6
But what does that gonna do...,4
