Not talking over meals is supposed to be good for the health . It is impolite if people do not talk to each other during a social party . The table arrangements and serving order for a social party are equally complicated . Each dish should be placed in the correct position . When fish is served , the tail should be pointing at the guest because tail meat is supposed to be tasty . If it is in winter , the stomach should face the right-hand side of the guest because that portion of the fish is very rich in winter . Each dish should be commenced by the eldest person who is seated at the head of the table . The diners should sit close to the table so food won ' t drop on their cloths . No noise should be made when chewing . No one should move food back to the communal plate even if he doesn ' t like it . One should drink soup slowly and is not supposed to make a lot of noise . All these table manners are very similar to Western habits . ",0

1," I have had an incredible boss , who was my direct supervisor during the last year of my coop work experience . A-bout two months after I began working for her , she really let me spread my wings . She encouraged me to work independently , because she said she had come to trust my judgment and commitment . So I was able to move forward on projects without having to check in with her every day . Of course , I made certain that she knew what I had accomplished on a daily and weekly basis because I gave her summary reports , although she didn't specifically ask me to . Without her support and encouragement , I don't think I would have felt confident enough to have written up a proposal suggesting that the department change a process that had been in place for a long time . But she was open to suggestions , so long as employees could back them up with research and facts . When I submitted my suggestion , she reviewed it and told me where she thought it needed more work . She then took my revised proposal to her boss . He was a more conservative type , but she lobbied him to try It for several weeks . He did , and it was so successful that it was instituted as a permanent change . I've also worked for some very difficult bosses in summer and part-time jobs . And while I'd certainly prefer to work for one like I've just described , I'm the kind of person who can get along with just about anyone . ",0

When I looked down , I was nervous even more . If the cord had broken , I would be knocked to ' bakemeat ' . However , I knew my worries were unwanted . I was afraid if I retreated others might say something about me . I had to harden my heart and impose my head downward . I only felt wind wiring at my ears . My body rapidly descended . I thought that after only seven or eight seconds I was rebounded to upper air by the cord . In fact it was 30 seconds . Maybe because of my nervousness , I only felt seven or eight seconds .

4," Really ? You don ' t look very Chinese to me , if you don ' t mind me saying so . ",6
5," It ' s fine . I am actually from Mexico . I was in China on a business trip , visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products . ",4

0,"Look , daddy is on again . Don't you think he is handsome ? ",4
1," To some extent , he is . And what do you think we move to a better place ? I can't see him clearly from here . ",4
2," The seats in the middle of this stadium are great , but they're already occupied by somebody else . ",4
3," Oh , thank you for pointing that out . By the way , have you been following NBA for this season ? ",4

1," I do not know what I could imagine , but I confess that I have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers . ",4
2," Such an eye ! The true hazel eye-and so brilliant ! Regular features , open countenance , with a complexion , Oh ! What a bloom of full health , and such a pretty height and size ; such a firm and upright figure ! There is health , not merely in her bloom , but in her air , her head , her glance . One hears sometimes of a child being ' the picture of health ' ; now , she always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown-up health . She is loveliness itself . ",4
2," I am calling to inform you that we're happy to have you with us . Welcome aboard , I'm sure your friend would have given you a lot of information of our school and its motto , ways of teaching , etc . ",4

0,I'm so nervous about this oral test . ,3
0,I had a wonderful evening . ,4
1, Sally ? She is a bachelor girl . She is an excellent designer . Many of the company's advertisements are her child trains . ,4
5, Why on earth would she do that ? You mean that she intentionally did not eat any food for days ? That's crazy ! ,6
7, I can't believe that there are girls who are willing to do that to their bodies . And all for a certain look . ,6
3," Oh , really ? So , Spain is through to the next round ? ",6
0,Get up as early as six o'clock only to be jammed at every crossroad and still late for work . What a life ! I've had enough of it . ,2
1," Cool down , man . Everyone is fed up with the rush-hour traffic . But life isn't really all that . You should take the initiative and make some changes first . ",4
3," I recommend you ride a bike instead of commuting by bus . It may offer you many benefits . First , it's good for your health . I'm afraid it's not necessary for me to further elaborate . While lots of people spend time like an hour each morning exercising , a bike ride to work not only builds you up , but also makes full use of time . You might as well sleep out for a longer hour . ",4
4," I know cycling is always a more favorable choice than a bus . After all , it's a sport . But do you think it a pleasant experience to take in the dirty , polled air on the road ? ",2
5," Well , such things are just unavoidable in a great metropolis like Beijing . I think a still more desirable benefit is psychological . Bicycling home after work can help release your stress . Life in the offices is miserable . You just sit there in a daze , gazing at the monitor and dealing with files and documents . Why don't you give a full play to your energy after work ? Enjoy the speed on the road . Just think , you are flashing past the poles with your own energy . How great ! ",4
0,I'm terribly nervous . ,3
6, Really ? Is he married ? ,6
9, I try to keep it to myself . But there is a lot of gossip about us . ,5
11," Worse still , he is trying to avoid me these days . ",5
13, It gives me a lot of pressure and I feel depressed . ,5
2, Thanks so much . ,4
3, I like the way that the gifts I get increasingly more lavish . ,4
10, That sucks . You wanna go grab a beer ? ,4
11, Sure . Sounds great . Let's go . ,4
0,Tony looks very handsome in the suit . ,4

1, That's wonderful . Congratulations . ,4
2," Thank you , Linda . We would love you to come to our wedding . ",4

8, that looks lovely . Just one more thing---you need a pair of earrings . ,4
9, I've got a pair of pearl earrings . Here it is . ,4
10, perfect ! ,4
11," you have good fashion sense , Karen . ",4
12, thanks . We should be ourselves . There are so many fashion victims out there . ,4
13," yes , but with our sense we'll always look good . ",4
0,Susan ? What brings you here today ? ,6
2, Really ? So what ' s the news ? ,6
2," Wow , that should be really exciting , especially with so many famous athletes there . ",4
3," Yes , I ' m also going to watch the triple jump and the high jump . ",4
4, Well have a good time . Get me some autographs if you can . ,4
5," Ok , I ' ll try my best . ",4
0,I am having a hard time at my job . ,5
2," My colleagues quickly get promotions , while I always get sidelined . I don't know what to do anymore . ",5
4, But I don't know what else I can do . I am willing to work hard . Sometimes I make mistakes and the boss is not happy . ,5
12," Well , if he can become president , then I can at least get a promotion . ",4

2, Why is that ? It is called real art . ,6
1, Really ? That's really wonderful . I'm so happy for her . ,4
2, But I always feel disappointed . I have many problems with English learning . ,5
4, I feel confused about the grammars . ,5
6, And my writing is not good . I feel so frustrated . ,5
8," I know that , mom . But sometimes I'm just sad . ",5
10," Yes , mom . You are right . Nothing is impossible to a willing heart . I will keep going . ",4
1, fantastic ! I got an overall score of eight . ,4
17," that's be great . The more prepared I am , the better . ",4
6, Wow . I really like California ... the weather there is much better than the East Coast . ,4
0,I dislike Susan . She is always above herself . ,2
2, What of it ? ,6
9, 25 cents a day ? ,6
11, That ' s expensive . ,6

3," Me , too . What did you have in mind ? ",4
4," I haven't decided yet , but I think the Olympic Mascots are a must . ",4
5," I agree . They're very lovely , especially Huanhuan ",4
6," Is that the red one ? That is my favorite , too . Do you know how much they are ? ",4
7," The five dolls are sold together as a set , and they're priced according to the size . The bigger they are the more expensive . ",4
8," Oh , I see . If I buy more than a set , can I get any discount ? ",4
9, I don't think so . All the souvenirs of the Olympic Games are very hot right now . ,4
10, Any other ideas ? ,4
11," There are lots of things , such as postcards , key chains , posters and various arts and crafts . ",4
12, It all sounds great . We can go there after the match . I can't wait to see what they have . ,4

0,"Hello , Julia , I know a party that will begin at midnight . Would you love to go ? ",4
1," I'd love to , but my mother asks me to go home before 11:00 every night . She will worry if I get home late . ",4

4, So do you ! How are you doing ? ,4
4," Yes , I really weak in maps , I did poorly in high school . ",5

4, Good ? ! For them but not to me . ,6
7, I would buy that kind of book ! ,4
1, It was terrific.The concert was really a hit.The symphony orchestra was so good that I was completely absorbed in their performance . ,4

8, Me too . I finally understand why a small shop like this can always befilmed with dozens of people . ,4
9," To be honest , I care only about whether I can have some delicious candy eat . I couldn't care less about whether the shop is popular or not . ",4
10, You are a candy terminator . Be careful or you'll get a lot of cavities . ,4

15, Say hello to your friends for me . ,4
9, Great ! You are all set to enjoy the library . ,4
3," Nothing , thanks . I am just not in the mood these days . ",4
6," That all depends on what you like to do . For example , I like to doodle on the notepad , so I'm thinking about doing some real drawings . ",4
7, I like to play the piano for fun . ,4
8, Yeah . That can be a good hobby . ,4
9, Hobbies are great . I'm going to make a list of all the things I like to do . ,4
10, That's a great idea . I'm going to do the same . ,4
1, You ! ,1
3, You told Martha that I was on a date ? What was that all about ? ,1
6, I'm sorry man . I didn't know . I didn't mean to screw anything up . ,5

8, Bye bye ! Have a pleasant journey ! ,4
3, With snow in Kunming ? That's crazy ! ,6
5, I really don't want to know about this . Physics gives me a headache . ,5
0,Guess what I've brought for you . ,4
1," Oh , a bouquet of flowers . It's very kind of you . ",6
2, I hope you like it . ,4
3," I love flowers , you know . Thank you very much . ",4
4, That's all right . ,4
1," I like girls who like to have fun , and aren't too serious . ",4
2, I agree . I like guys that can make me laugh . ,4
3, That's true . Having a very serious boyfriend or girlfriend can be boring . ,4
1, My car won ' t start ! Stupid old car ! ,1
11, Umm . yeah ! Right ! I got the car started ! Thanks for your help ! I told you to fill the tank ! ,4
4, That ' s great . Those athletes must train for years to get into peak physical condition . They must be terribly disappointed if they don ' t win . ,4
6, That ' s amazing ! Were any other records broken ? ,6
1," Thanks , Jim . I didn ' t think guys paid attention to stuff like that . ",4
3," Well , thanks for the compliment anyway ! ",4
5, France ? Is he crazy ? ,6
1, My house was robbed last night and the thieves stole all my furniture . ,5
3," Yes , I have . But I have to wait . ",5
2, Do more exercises after you are healthy . ,4
3," Ok , I will . You have said that many times . ",4

2," Oh , no . ",6
6, I sure did . ,5
3, I cannot belive that . It must be cooked up by someone . ,6
3, Really ? ,6
8, there's a gym nearby ? That's exciting ! I really want to start to go to gym as soon as possible . I've been lazy this summer holiday and have put on some weight . ,4
10, that would be wonderful . Thanks ! ,4
0,I am totally fed up with my boss . He has crossed the line one too many times with his sexist comments . This time I am really going to report him for sexual harassment . ,2
2," He constantly lets inappropriate things slip out , referring to the women employees as girls or calling us sweetheart or darling . I doubt any of my male colleagues would stand for such treatment . ",2
4," You ' re missing the point . It ' s about respect . He treats us with such a patronizing attitude , as if we are not equal or not as serious as our male co-workers . It ' s his attitude that needs to be changed , not just his words . ",2
0,"Is your lady beautiful ? Since I came here from the country , I've not seen her close . Tell me , is she beautiful ? ",4
1," Thomas , if I could write with the beauty in her eyes , I was born to look in them and know myself . ",4
3, Her lips ? The early morning rose would wither on the branch if it could feel envy . ,4
5," Deeper , softer , none of your twittering larks . I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupted her song . ",4
6," Oh , she sings too ? ",6
7," Constantly . Without doubt , and plays the lute . She has a natural ear . ",4
0,"It's going to strike 12 o'clock . Let's get the firecrackers ready , Rose . ",4
1, Aren't firecrackers forbidden in the city ? ,6
2," Well yes , but they are not allowed only in downtown areas . It's OK here . It would be difficult to ban customs that have thousands of years of tradition . The habit does bring kids joy and excitement so long as precautions are taken . Let's go out and set off firecrackers out there . ",4
3, Fantastic ! The whole city is echoing with crackling sounds ! ,4
6," Fine , then ! If that ' s the way you feel , so be it . But you ' re losing out on a great opportunity here . I ' m going to go hit up Mum for the cash . ",1
0,A beautiful center ! ,4
1, And good shot ! ,4
2, A goal ! ,4
6, You are a smart girl ! ,4

1," I get along pretty well with most of them.It seems there are always a few rotten apples in the bunch , though , Like Margaret . I don't know why management hasn't fired her yet.She ' s a terrible gossip . ",2
0,Thanks a lot for having us . We had a good time . ,4
1, I'm glad you came . You're welcome anytime . ,4
2," Thanks . By the way , tell your wife she throws a great party . ",4
3, I will . See you later . ,4
2," Oh , really ? Which bulletin board ? ",6
0,Have you seen that house ? ,4
1," Yes , it looks interesting . ",4
2, You're right . I love it very much . ,4
12, Frightened ? You must be joking . ,6
0,Have a nice weekend ! ,4
1, Thanks.You too ! ,4
0,Ouch ! ,6
0,"Hi , Lilly , it ' s so nice to see you again . ",4
3," You know , I like traveling . I made good use of this long vacation and enjoyed myself . ",4
0,"It's a lovely day , isn't it ? ",4
1," Yes , the weather sure is nice today . ",4
2, I love it when the weather is like this.Why don't we sit down outside and have our lunch ? ,4
3," That sounds like a good idea.The sky is clear , the sun is shining and there's a nice cool breeze , so it is not too hot . ",4
4," I really miss the change of seasons like we have in Colorado.but I must admit , this sure is a nice spring day . ",4
5," Hey , this spot in the shade looks really comfortable . ",4
12, Thanks for letting me know . I feel relieved now . ,4
2," Only four days ! That's so short , and you seem so crazy about her . ",6

3," Definitely , it's time to say bye-bye to the last year and to say hello to the new year ! ",4
4, Yeah . Have you made any good resolutions for this new year ? ,4
5," Some resolutions ? That's a wonderful idea , but I have no idea yet . How about you ? ",4
6," I want to be healthier this year , so I think I should take more exercise . ",4
7, That will be a good one ! Anything else ? ,4
8," Maybe I should make a plan about learning my biochemistry , which is a mess ! ",4
9, Sounds great ! ,4
0,"It's weekend again , I'm glad I can arrange for my personal matters . ",4
2," Oh , that means I can do whatever I like without few interruptions . ",4
6," Oh , you can't think like that . We young people should try our best to learn new things and accept new ideas . You like taking photos and going to photography shows , why not practise the technique and catch something unforgeable ? ",4
7, That's a good suggestion . It's fine today . Maybe I can take photos on the scenery of the lake at sunset . It must be fantastic . ,4
8," I quite agree with you . With our hobbies , our life can be more colorful and exciting . ",4
9, And I can concentrate on my study after the relaxation over the weekend . ,4
10," Yes , it's a good habit to have a life-long hobby . Those who practise calligraphy and Qigong always live longer . ",4
3, Really ? Are you OK ? ,6
11, Thank you for all your help . ,4
0,"Wow , American football is more exciting than I thought . ",4
2," Oh , right . So , I can ' t quite follow what ' s going on ... who ' s winning ? ",4
3," The Giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked , but the Redskins have the ball and there pretty close to the end zone . ",4
4, Wow ! What a hit ! ,6
5," Yeah , he tackled him so hard his helmet came off . ",4
2," Well , this is my new baby . He ' s just as much trouble . That ' s for sure ! But , he ' s a lot of fun ! ",4
0,"How old are you , Su ? ",4
1, I am seven . ,4
2," I see , you have seven candles on the cake . ",4
3," Yes , I am seven . I am a big girl now . ",4
4," We will have a party here , right ? ",4
5," Yes , come on , and we will have fun . ",4
0,I've had enough of that ! ,2

2," Yes . The drinks are very good ! I'm Paul , by the way . ",4

0,I'm so excited ! We have two weeks off ! What are you going to do ? ,4
1, I'm not sure . I guess I'll just stay at home . Maybe I'll catch up on my reading . What about you ? Any plans ? ,4
2," Well , my parents have rented a condominium in Florida . I'm going to take long walks along the beach every day and do lots of swimming . ",4
3, Sounds great ! ,4
4," Say , why don't you come with us ? We have plenty of room . ",4
5, Do you mean it ? I'd love to ! ,4
0,I can't stand the stupid guy any longer.It ' s unbelievable ! ,1

5, You needn ' t buy one . You can have mine . ,4
6," That ' s very kind of you , Helen . I hope you don ' t mind my leaving you like this . I need a holiday . It won ' t be long . ",4
7," Don ' t be silly , John . I ' m going with you . It ' s necessary for me to have a holiday too . ",4
7, Thank you for your advice . I ' ll try it . ,4
3," I'm keen on talking short trips to nearby scenic spots . More often than not , I go with some of my friends . By the way , what are your favorites ? ",4
4," I love swimming and cycling . On Sunday morning I have swimming practice for an hour . In the afternoon , I just ride my bike around the city or along the country roads for almost two hours . ",4
5, That's great ! I think they do you a lot of good . Where do you swim ? ,4
7, I'm fond of dancing . ,4

4, Wow ! Isn ' t that dangerous ? ,6
5," A little , but the rush was worth it . ",4
6, Tell me about it . ,4
7, We jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us . ,4
8, 500 feet ! I would never be able to do that . ,6
9," Yeah , it was scary , but exhilarating . ",4
1, It ' s pretty good . ,4

3," Well , I have acrophobia . I have a chronic fear of flying . ",3

5, It's no big deal . ,4
7," Don't be silly , forget about it . ",4
0,It smells like an ashtray in here ! ,1
2, What ' s wrong ? I thought we agreed that you were gonna quit smoking . ,1
4," Look , there are other ways to quit . You can try the nicotine patch , or nicotine chewing gum . We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place . It ' s not like you can just light up like before . ",1
6, Fine ! I want a divorce ! ,1
1, Really ? ,6
3, I will . Thanks for telling me . ,4
1, I didn't pass the English exam . How to learn English well ? Can you give me some suggestions ? ,5

6, I know that . You don't have to tell me that . That's my problem . I know I have the right to work for the university . That's legal.But they don't have a job for me . And it's illegal for me to get a job elsewhere . ,5
12, I already had that idea . ,5
18, I have to find something.Otherwise I have to go back to Taiwan . I'll be broke in two months . ,5
3, Thank you so much . You're an expert . ,4

4, It seems you two are a good match . What qualities do you look for in a friend ? ,4

9, Of course . What do you want to move first ? ,4
10, Let ' s move the sofa . Can you get a grip on the bottom at that end ? I ' ll lift this end . I want to move it sideways in that direction . ,4
5, Good . See you later . ,4
6, Thank you . Good-bye . ,4
0,That woman is a thorough drag ! ,2
2, She keeps spitting on the ground . ,2
4, Why didn ' t you just answer my question directly ? Why would Chinese answer questions this way ? I simply asked if you did it or not . It ' s a very simple question . And Chinese often give the reason before they would give a direct answer . ,1
8," Yeah , after all the explanations like , it ' s too heavy , I was in a hurry ... whatever . ",1
1, That would be very nice . Only that I ' ll be a little late . Is that OK ? ,4
2, Sure . We ' ll be looking forward to that day . ,4
3, So will I . Thank you . ,4
0,I think it's going to be a nice day . ,4
1, It's certainly a big improvement over yesterday . ,4
3, Sure . ,4
3," It ' s the same in Balloon . But I definitely think we over-tipped the cab driver . The fare was twenty dollars , and you gave him a five-dollar tip . That ' s twenty-five percent of the total ! Too much ! ",6
3, Right ! I'll do it straight away . ,4
4, Thanks a lot . I'm most grateful . ,4
1, Taylor ? Taylor ! Is this a joke ? Is it really you ? But ... but ... everyone said you were dead ! ,6

3," My pleasure . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer , and I suppose you dance often . ",4
4," Me ? Oh , no . In fact , I only took up dancing quite recently . ",6
5," Oh , really ? But you're doing the waltz wonderfully well . ",6
6, I'm glad you say so . You dance beautifully too . It's lucky that I got you as a partner . ,4
7, Thank you for your compliments . It's just you are a good leader . Do you like the foxtrot and tango ? ,4
8, Yes . And what dances do you like best ? ,4

11, My pleasure . ,4

7," Sorry , I'm very near sighted . ",5
6," I appreciate it , thank you . ",4

2," Yes . Nice to meet you , Mrs Smith . ",4
3," Nice to meet you too , Mr . Zhang . ",4
3," That ' s great . If you don ' t mind my asking , does your company give bonuses ? ",4

0,Stephanie ! Did you just get to school ? But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning ! That was about an hour and a half ago . This happens all the time ! Why do you always take so long to get ready the morning ? ,1
2," Please explain because it makes no sense to me . How can a girl ' s routine be so complicated ? You get up , you shower , you get dressed , you brush your teeth , you ' re out the door . Half an hour , tops . ",1
3," Jacob , you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling . I don ' t . I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ' s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ' ll put my hair up , but oftentimes I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing .

1, Our meal was absolutely perfect ! ,4
3," Dessert sounds perfect , but I would like to split something with my friends . ",4

0,"I am really exhausted , you know , I have been working without the weekend for two weeks . My boss always asks us to work overtime . ",5
4," We all know about that , but we have no choice . The chairman of the trade union says he is going to negotiate with the management . ",5
6, that seems like an awful waste ! Why don't people order fewer dishes so that they don't have to throw so much away at the end of the meal ? ,1
14," that's OK . I'll try anything once , but sometimes , once is enough ! ",4
1, Yes . I think so . It ' s not a very expensive apartment . It ' s in the right area and it has everything that we are looking for . The rooms are quite large too . ,4

13," Okay , I ' Ve decided . I ' m going to pop the question ! ",4
14, Fabulous ! We should look at engagement rings then ! Now that ' s a whole other section . ,4
6, So coincidental . Actually we can exchange some information on this problem . ,4
0,Cheers ! Let ' s tie one on . ,4
1," Right , drink as much as you can . ",4
4, Thank you very much . ,4
0,I swear I will never shop at a street market in China . It's a terrible place full of excellent profiteers ! You have to keep an eye whenever it comes to paying for something . ,1
2," yes . Last Sunday I went to a nearby market . It was on open-air fair . I chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot , without even trying to strike a bargain . I paid one hundred and twenty . And just now I was told by my Chinese colleagues I bought it overpriced . I could have talked my way to thirty . ",1

8, You're welcome . I hope you'll be more comfortable in your new room . ,4
8," That'll be $ 4 . 25 ... ( The customer gives her a 5 dollar bill . ) ... out of five . Here is your change , sir . Have a nice day . ",4
4, Thank you very much . ,4

6, And you're going to dust every piece of furniture in the house ! ,1
0,We really were lucky . We got the last available table for two---and we didn't even have a reservation ! Did you see the long lines behind us ? ,4
1," Yeah , I'm glad that we didn't have to wait long . I'm starving ! ",4
6, Sounds good . What are you going to have for your main course ? ,4

9," Thanks . You ' d be ok on your own . There are loads of fashion victims out there , and you are not one of them . Have you tried it on yet ? ",4
11, That looks great . Just one more thing---you need some high heels with those jeans . Do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ? ,4
14, That ' s even better than the real thing . ,4
1," What a find ! So , how much does it cost ? ",4

4," I'm not sure , but I think so . I'm very exhaust but I can't sleep . ",5

4, Thanks a lot . ,4
5, You ' re welcome . ,4
1, Are you kidding ? It ' s summer . ,6
3, Really ? It's unbelievable . ,6
3," I am afraid not , darling . Our expenses are mounting . ",5
6," Sure , if you've got any problem you can ask me . ",4

",4
6, I ' m sorry ? ! ,6
8, Great . This is exactly what I was looking for . I'll buy it . ,4
9, I think you'll love this pan . Do you want to pay with cash ? ,4
4, That sounds good . Last year I paid $ 30 . ,4
7, Very good . Would you like anything else ? ,4
9, She should be very pleased with these roses . ,4
7, Really ! So it is just near my office building . Great ! How much is the rent ? ,4
17, All right ! Thank you . ,4
0,"This is a very spacious apartment . It's forty pings , including the parking space . That's about one thousand four hundred square feet . ",4
4," Exactly , which is why a three-bedroom is better . And look , there are two bathrooms . ",4
5, Now that's a plus ! ,4
6, That's fantastic . I think I like this one . ,4
7, A good choice . I prefer that one myself . ,4

11, Don ' t mention it . ,4
3, Sure that sounds great ! Are there any other fees ? ,4
5, Perfect . I also wanted to know if there is any call forwarding service ? I am usually out of town and would like my calls to be forwarded to a local number . ,4
1, I think is looks great . I really like the light colors you have chosen . The pictures are nice too . Did you buy any new furniture ? ,4
7, I like to get rid of clothes that I don ' t wear rather than keeping them in a wardrobe . They take up too much space . There are several charity shops that you can give old clothes to . They will be happy to receive them as long as they are in reasonable condition . ,4
8," That ' s a good idea . After I get rid of the old clothes I no longer wear , I can see what new clothes I need to buy . ",4
11," Anyway , we are arriving at Danshui soon . I can't wait to watch the beautiful sunset . ",4
0,"After this lunch , I haven ' t got much green left . ",5

1, That ' s great to hear . ,4
6, You got it . Good job . ,4
5," Why ? I mean , what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ? ",6
4," Hmm , I don't feel very comfortable . ",5
6, This is just right for me . I'll take this one . ,4
6, What ' s that ? It gets the name from the festival itself . That ' s really funny ! ,4
8," Oh , I know Tangyuan . It ' s a sweet snack , good for dessert . ",4
11," Oh , the smelly bean curd . My favorite ! ",4
2," Have fun ! I plan to spend some more time with my grandkids , and I might even go back to school . ",4
2, Look ! The iron is still on . ,6
5," I ' m sorry , Jim . ",5
2," 553-2213 . Great , thanks . ",4
0,I don't know how to adjust my life . Would you give me a piece of advice ? ,5
2," Yes , I can't sleep well every night . ",5
4, I drink a lot of wine . ,5
6, I often feel so tired . ,5
8, I sometimes find the shadow of death in front of me . ,3
0,"Welcome to our show ! Today , I am going to show you how to make the perfect mouthwatering sandwich ! Are you ready ? Let ' s get started ! ",4
1," Let ' s start with the basics , bread . Bread is an important ingredient here . You need to remember one thing - choose the bread according to the following criteria , freshness , crumb and color . If you want a closed sandwich I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven , or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color . ",4
2," Now that our bread is ready , let ' s talk about the ingredients ! Of course , each person ' s palate is different , but I ' m going to give you a few tips that you ' ll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the perfect sandwich . I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich . ",4
3," Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and light . The best choices here are evident — cucumbers , tomatoes , onions , sweet pepper or chilli , lettuce and , of course , herbs — you can ' t go wrong with them . As for aubergines , mushrooms and asparagus , I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil . ",4
4," Last but not least , we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich . We can be subtle and just add a touch of salt and pepper , or we can combine mustard sauce , mayonnaise , ketchup or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor ! It ' s always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt ! ",4
5," That ' s all the time we have for today , but join us next time where we ' ll be going over how to make the perfect lasagna ! Till next time ! ",4
2, Great ! Thanks a lot ! ,4
3," No problem , John . ",4
3, Really ? Ugh ... Is there any difference ? ,6
5, Gee . I must have left it in my hotel room . ,5
9," Oh , my God ! What do I do now ? Bone head , bone head , bone head ( He smashes his head with his hand . ) . ",5
13," Oh , thank God . Thank you , I'll be right back . ",4
16," Thank you , thank you , thanks again . ",4
7, Maybe now I ' ll get that promotion I was hoping for . ,4
4, Maybe that's what I'll do . Thanks a lot . ,4
5, You're welcome . ,4
0,"My dear , it's five flights up ! ",6

3," Thanks , I appreciate that ! ",4
4, You are a big fan of him ! He has strong legs . ,4
7," Oh , my God . It's disaster . It makes my head look like a soccer ball . ",1
10, Oh . I made a mistake . I thought the guy on the right was Peckham . ,5
12," Sorry , but do not worry . I think I can fix it . Just cut a little more off the temple . ",5
3," Like me ? But you see I am so successful now . And if he is really like me , he will be more successful than me in the future . ",1
5," Pay him ? But he studies for himself , not for you or for me or for anybody else . I got an idea . You should send him to class every morning and after the class begins , you can go to work . ",1
4, Great . That ' s just the sort of thing I'm looking for . Thanks . ,4
6, I'm glad you like them .. . We'd appreciate your kind consideration in the coming negotiation . Let's drink to our friendship . ,4
7, Let's hope for good cooperation between us . ,4
6, I appreciate it . Thank you . ,4
7, That's all right . ,4
5, Thank you . ,4
0,Why don ' t you introduce him ? I wonder if we will become good friends . ,4
5, I see . Thanks for your drive . ,4
9," Here's your change , 50 Yuan . Welcome back again . ",4
2, Great ! Our president has asked me to come over to invite you to the banquet held in your honor at the Beijing Hotel at 7:00 . Here's an invitation card for you . ,4
5," That's good . It's most thoughtful of you to do this , Miss Wood . ",4
6," It's my pleasure . Well , then , see you tomorrow . ",4
0,How beautiful the flower is ! ,4
1," Really , it's so beautiful . ",3
1, I apologize . This should not have to be this way . ,5
3," Of course , I should have been more careful . I ' m sorry . ",5
6, You have good taste . Let my show you what I have . ,4
7," Well , we have some special projects coming up . Would you be interested in working on any of those ? ",4
8," Yes , I would love to work on a special project ! ",4
9," Well then , I'll keep you in the loop . Thank you for your help today . ",4
0,"Wow , Amy , look at that number . ",4
2, What do you mean ? It's a scrim . ,6
4, I love that kind of stuff . ,4
5, Thank you so much . ,4
11, Thanks a lot . ,4
9, Thanks very much and goodbye ! ,4
6, Sounds good . May I come over tomorrow to take a look ? ,4

9," Good , May I have your name , please ? ",4
11," Thanks for calling , Blanca . I'll see you tomorrow . ",4
0,I swear I will never shop at a street market in China . It's a terrible place full of excellent profiteers ! You have to keep an eye whenever it comes to paying for something . ,1
3, No ! Are you kidding me ? ,6
4, I ' m afraid not . I apologize . ,5
5, I can ' t believe it ! I have all my important personal documents stored in that computer . It ' s no laughing matter . ,1
6, I told you I ' m sorry . What can I do to make it up to you ? ,5
7," Well , you should be sorry ! Don ' t ever use my computer again ! You can ' t do anything now , it ' s too late ! ",1

4, Wow ! You're right . Everything is absolutely delicious . Please pass the pepper . ,4
9, Here's to our friendship and health ! ,4
10, Bottoms up ! ,4
2, That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ' s really annoying ! ,1
3, Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ' s why the parking lot was flooded . ,1
4, I know ! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him . ,1
3, Yes . Thank you so much . ,4
6, Thank you . Your cash back is $ 13 . Pull into a parking space . And we'll bring out your fries in two minutes . ,4

6, You are welcome ! ,4
6, There are nine cockroaches in my room . I don't have time for your disbelief ! ,1
4," I see , thank you very much ! ",4
1, I ' m sorry sir . This computer is not broken or damaged . It ' s simply just too old ! That ' s why your programs and applications are running slow . There really isn ' t much I can do . ,5
2, What do you mean ? I bought this computer just three years ago ! ,6
6, I have no idea what you are talking about . I just want to know if it ' s good and if I will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time ! ,1
7," This PC is top of the line and I guarantee it will never freeze ! If it does , we ' ll give you your money back ! ",1
2," It's very good , and it's fresh too . ",4
11, Thanks for letting me know . ,4
8, I enjoyed talking to you . ,4
9, I liked talking to you too . ,4
6, That's a good idea . I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play singsong . Perhaps we can make a foursome with them . ,4
7," Sounds great to me ! If they are willing , we could ask them to go dancing with us . That is excellent exercise and fun , too . ",4
8, Good . Let's go now . ,4
6, thank you . I couldn't wait any longer to have a taste . ,4
8," oh , it's terrific . I love the floor . Can you tell me how it was prepared ? ",4
10, it sounds really complicated . No wonder it tastes so great . ,4
3," I'm sorry , madam , there ' s a limit to the speed . ",5
4, Damn it ! I think I'm going to miss the plane . ,1
8, Really ? Great ! ,4
2, Come on ! It ' ll be fun . We play every other Saturday afternoon from May until August . ,4
3, Okay . I guess I could give it a try . ,4
7, Thank you . ,4
8, Welcome to my shop next time . ,4
7, Thank you . ,4
9, It ' s a fun job . ,4
1, I cut it on that blade . ,5
14," Are you kidding ? I always get up late . Oh , my God . Can't believe that . That is terrible . ",6
7," I'm in a bit of a hurry today , so we'd better make it to go . Thanks for asking . ",4
2, Out ? What do you mean out ? ,6
14, That sounds good . ,4

2," Oh dear , I forgot to bring it . ",5
6, Then I'll accept it with thanks . ,4
1," Yeah , yeah , we ' re here because we feel this is an injustice ! The financial irresponsibility of big business has to stop ! We ' re there to show the government that we don ' t like the way that they ' re spending our tax dollars ! ",1
3," It ' s an absolute outrage , Sarah , the US government wants to give 25 billion dollars of taxpayers ' money to the auto industry . These are companies that have been mismanaged and are now nearly bankrupt . ",1
5," That maybe true , and I for one don ' t want to see anyone lose their job , but how can these Ces ask for a bailout when they ' re making millions of dollars ? And then , they have the nerve to fly to Washington in private jets ! This costs hundreds of thousands of dollars ! And they ' re asking for money ! That is just not right ! ",1
7, Terrific ! When are you moving in ? ,4
2," What ? A fire ? Oh , my God ! What shall I do ? Please get me out of here ! ",3
4, I can smell smoke ! ,3
10, Gosh ! I can see the flames ! ,3
2, What is it ? Why are all these clothes on the bed ? ,6
4, Are you joking ? What am I going to do with you ? We are going to a dinner party not the beach ! Wear the shirt with the silk tie I bought you and these corduroy pants . It ' s chilly outside so you can wear this coat . ,6
5," Thanks honey ! You have such great fashion sense . Now , what am I going to do with my hair ? ",4
3, Thank you . I'll have one . ,4
2, My fish is pretty dry too . ,5
3, It's almost as if this food has been sitting a little too long . It doesn't seem fresh . ,5
7, Mine are the same way . It seems like they've been overcooked . ,5
10, Thanks for your help . ,4
3," No , it's just perfect . ",4
5," No , really , it feels great . ",4
