6, You were lucky then . What did you do after that ? ,4
7, We went for a swim in the sea . That was the best part of the day . Just look at my nice tan . ,4
8, So you must have had a busy and enjoyable day yesterday . ,4

4, What ? What kind of drugs was he using ? ,6
6, I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs . ,2
7, They are . The only reason they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards . ,2
8, That's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs . ,2
9," I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country ! ",2
1," Yes , I am . I enjoyed studying it at school , though I had trouble remembering all the dates , so my teacher never gave me good marks . ",4

3, Yeah ... I know . But I'm sick and tired of all the office power struggles ! ,1
5," Basically , I think Tim is threatened by me . I'm doing a better job than he is so he's trying to sabotage my career ! ",1
7, Yes . He's all nice and friendly to my face . But the second I turn around he stabs me in the back ! ,1
0,"Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do ! ",3
