neu,Excuse me.
neu,Yeah.
neu,Is there a problem?
neu,Well what's the problem?  Let me change it.
fru,What?  I'm getting an ID.  This is why I'm here.  My wallet was stolen.
fru,How am I supposed to get an ID without an ID?  How does a person get an ID in the first place?
fru,I'm here to get an ID.
fru,Like what?  Like a birth certificate?
fru,"Yes but my wallet was stolen, I don't have anything.  I don't have any credit cards, I don't have my ID.  Don't you have things on file here?"
ang,That's out of control.
fru,How long have you been working here?
neu,"Clearly.  You know, do you have like a supervisor or something?"
fru,That would - I would appreciate that.  Yeah.
fru,Do you have your forms?
fru,Let me see them.
fru,Who told you to get in this line?
fru,Okay. But I didn't tell you to get in this line if you are filling out this particular form.
fru,This form is a Z.X.four.
fru,"You can't--  This is not the line for Z.X.four.  If you're going to fill out the Z.X.four, you need to have a different form of ID."
fru,No. I need another set of ID to prove this is actually you.
fru,I don't know.  But I need an ID to pass this form along.  I can't just send it along without an ID.
fru,"No.  I need another ID, a separate one."
fru,"A birth certificate, a passport...a student ID; didn't you go to school?  Anything?"
fru,"Yeah.  We keep it on file, but we need an ID to access that file."
ang,I don't understand why this is so complicated for people when they get here.  It's just a simple form.  I just need an ID.
ang,Yeah.  Do you want to see my supervisor?  Huh? Yeah.  Do you want to see my supervisor?  Fine.  I'll be right back.
sad,Did you get the mail? So you saw my letter?
sad,Yeah.  I know.
sad,I don't know.  I put in that. request too. They didn't...
neu,"I guess, you know, everybody has to make sacrifices."
sad,"There's people that have given more though, you know?"
sad,I know.
neu,"There's babies over there, though, that need mothers."
sad,"Just, you know, kicking myself."
sad,things just aren't what they seem.
sad,"If not me then, who?"
sad,"You'll videotape everything, yeah?"
sad,"Maybe you can send it to me, like stream it, yeah?"
sad,Last month--  Yeah.
neu,I have to find sitters.
sad,"We've got friends, that's why we moved here, huh?  Because there is a day care down the street."
neu,And your mother is close by.
sad,I'll send you lots of letters.
sad,And I want lots and lots and lots of pictures.
sad,"I don't understand.  You've already done so much, I don't know why do you have to go back."
fru,I just don't see how they can make you leave when you have a new baby - we have a new kid.
sad,I don't know how you can be okay with this?  I don't know why you're not-- you're fine with it.
fru,I know.
sad,I just don't see why it has to be you.
sad,What am I going to do? Huh?
sad,Yeah.
neu,Don't you guys have access to computers over there.
sad,I just don't know how I'm going to do it without you.
sad,I can't raise a baby by myself.  How?
neu,I know.
fru,It's just not fair.
hap,Well Vegas was awesome.
hap,"And, um, I got married."
hap,Yeah.  In the old town part.
hap,Um- Yes.  It was very romantic.
hap,It was at the slot machines.
hap,"Uhuh, uhuh.  He won big and he-and he realized that the only thing that would make it better was me as his bride."
hap,"Yeah.  Well.  You know, because he's leaving the next day."
hap,But we're going to have a honeymoon cruise.
hap,Oh.  I hadn't even thought about that.
hap,Oh.  Totally.
hap,I guess I'll-  I guess I'll have an internet husband.[LAUGHTER]
exc,"Yeah, so [LAUGHTER] He's calling me now"
hap,"He likes to keep tabs, you know."
neu,"Uh, I think seven hundred and fifty dollars."
neu,Penny slots. That's what he plays.
neu,Yeah.
hap,Yeah.  We played Wheel of Fortune pennies.  It's like a giant thing with like-
neu,Fifty bucks. Mmhmm.
neu,Yeah.
hap,Well so now we're married. We have cat children.
hap,"We renamed Brenda, Lumber Janet."
hap,She needs a new name each state that we go into. [LAUGHTER]
neu,So what's up?  What's new?
neu,Yeah.  I heard.
exc,Who did you marry?
neu,He turned to you and was like...
hap,[LAUGHTER] That's really romantic.
neu,Yeah.
neu,"Does that mean that you're going to get citizenship, too, in- in England or whatever?"
neu,Yeah.  But he'll have like a long visa.  Can you go visit then for a long time?
hap,Like you need another one of those.[LAUGHTER]
hap,Is that your phone?
hap,He loves you.
neu,How much did he win at the slot?
neu,I'm a big fan of the Wheel of Fortune quarters. But it just costs so much.  I don't know.
neu,"But the pennies always get you because you end up spending like, you know, fifty bucks."
neu,"like, wait, but it's just pennies.  You're like, wait a minute I'm on to you."
exc,Awesome.
hap,[LAUGHTER] Cat babies.
neu,That's fair enough.
neu,"Uh, what?  Craig's List?  Oh the internet thing?"
neu,I don't know.  Isn't that-- that's all like escort services and things like that.
fru,"I don't know.  I mean I've been looking for so long that I just figured that--  I mean, I think things like Monster are a lot more reliable than just some random free board."
neu,He just...
neu,you know what?  I heard about that job.  I applied for that.
fru,Yeah.  I saw a posting at the theatre.
neu,Yeah.
neu,I just- I mean I call people up and I tell them what I'm good at.
neu,Yeah.
fru,I'm there in front of them.  I'm telling them what I'm good at.
fru,Why?  It's a piece of paper.
fru,"I just don't want this paper trail, you know.  I just don't want things following me around, like-."
fru,"It's just-- You know, I've had this problem before.  You're not the first person to tell me that I need a resume but..."
fru,"That's baloney, that's baloney."
fru,Please.
fru,you think that you're better than me because I don't have a car?
fru,"You know, you're riding the bus, too."
fru,Why?  What choice?
fru,You're saving the environment. mmhmm
fru,Interesting.  That's fantastic.
ang,I'm not frustrated.
ang,Who do you think you are?
ang,You are so high and mighty.  I just--
ang,Oh.  I'm saving the environment. I'm riding this car because I- I want to.
ang,"The bus, I'm riding the bus because I want to."
ang,I can not-- you are not here by choice.  Nobody would ride this bus by choice.
neu,"Have you tried, uh, Craig's List?"
neu,Yeah.
neu,No.  There's regular jobs on there.
neu,Uh huh.
neu,I'm just saying I have a friend that got a good job on it so I was just recommending it.
neu,He's like a manager for a theatre.
neu,He's like a house manager. Yeah.  It's a good job.
neu,You did?
neu,Yeah.
neu,You've been looking for a job for a long time; that was a long time ago.  Right?
neu,Hmm.
neu,I don't know.  He had a really good resume I guess and--
neu,Yeah.  Do you have a resume?
neu,It's kind of helpful when getting a job.
neu,Well maybe we should sit down some time and you can just tell me all the stuff that you have done and I'll write it out.
neu,"No.  You can- or you can just bring it in person.  But they need, generally, something to see, you know, what kind of what that you've done, what kind of--"
neu,"Yeah.  But the piece of paper helps, too."
neu,"No.  But it has an outline, you know."
neu,"I know.  Okay.  Well, um. Maybe--"
neu,Yeah.
neu,"Okay, yeah.  I would imagine."
neu,"Well, sometimes you have to do things that you don't necessarily like to do to have a job. But the job affords you money, you won't have to be taking the bus right now."
neu,maybe get a car.
neu,"I just, you know, think you should try a little harder maybe."
neu,I didn't say that.
neu,"I am riding the bus, but by choice."
neu,"To save the environment, carpool."
neu,Yes.  One less car at a time.
neu,Mmhmm.
fru,"You know, you don't have to take out your frustration on me, you know, just because..."
fru,...you can't get a job and refuse to have a resume.
neu,I don't think I'm anyone.
neu,I- I-I didn't-- okay.
fru,What? Oh.  So now you're...
fru,you know what?  You don't have to take your anger and your hurt out on me.
fru,Hi.
fru,Yeah. This is the fourth line that I have been in.
fru,I need my bag.
fru,"I flew in over three hours ago, I've been in four different lines."
fru,I waited the entire baggage- I waited for the whole baggage carousel four times.  They told me to go to the next one.  I waited through that for three planes and now I'm here.
fru,Nash.
fru,Yes.
ang,Flight seven fourteen.
ang,"Am I going to be getting, like, free tickets, free mileage. When can I expect my bag here?"
ang,Is this a joke?
ang,"Are there candid cameras?  Is this that movie? There's that show, right?  Airplane, airline."
ang,"You're kidding me, this is a joke."
ang,Do you have any idea-- fifty dollars?  That's supposed to replace everything that I have?  Do you understand how much I have packed in there? Not only does it have sentimental value; it can't be replaced like that.  It was incredibly expensive.
ang,We flew in from Paris.  I've been shopping for three weeks.
ang,I don't care what you're freaking sign says.  Somebody- Somebody needs to replace everything I've got there and give me money for my inconvenience.
ang,Do you understand who my husband is?
ang,"If you're- if you're- if you're looking for a lawsuit, baby, you've found it."
ang,Oh-Oh.  It's a gift.  You're-You're helping me out here?
ang,You are cruising for a bruising.  You are in so much trouble.
ang,Who's in charge?  Who is the president of Jet Blue?
ang,Because I probably know him.
ang,Yeah.
ang,"I don't want money, I want my clothes."
ang,What's your name?
ang,Okay.  I'll do that.
ang,I don't think you have done everything you could do because I don't have my bag here yet.
ang,A letter? I'll make a personal phone call.
neu,Hi.  Thanks for waiting.
hap,Can I help you?
hap,Uh huh.
neu,Okay.
neu,Okay.
neu,Okay.  Great.  I'm really sorry that you had to do that.  What's your last name?  Let's start there.
neu,Okay.
neu,all right- okay.  And you lost your bag? Is that- that the issue?
neu,Uh-huh.
neu,"Yeah. Yeah, I don't see- I don't see any--"
neu,"I don't see any record of it, and I-usually when I don't see a record of it, that means um-"
neu,"we've mistakenly lost your baggage.  We're very sorry.  On behalf of Jet Blue I would like to apologize for any inconvenience.  I am allowed to issue you a fifty dollar gift card which you can use any future flights you want to take with us.  I'm very sorry, once again..."
neu,"for such an inconvenience and your bag, but"
neu,Yeah.
neu,"No, no."
neu,"No, no.  This is real."
neu,"No.  I'm just giving you money, the bag is gone.  If it's not here, I'm really sorry there is nothing I can do because..."
neu,this is the only track record that we have and if it's not listed here then it's probably not anywhere.
neu,Yes.
neu,I know.
neu,Okay. Calm-
neu,"Actually, we are not necessarily liable to give you- to even give you this fifty dollars so... it's actually- it's actually really"
neu,"We are actually not even allowed--  you know, like we don't have to give you this fifty dollars.  We don't have to do that."
neu,It's a gift.
neu,"You know, the airlines can not be held responsible for every bag of luggage that comes through here."
neu,With the amount of--
neu,"Um, actually, I don't know. I don't know. Oh really?"
neu,Well then maybe you can just call him and he can give you more money.  But right now all I can do--
neu,"Right now all I can do is just give you this fifty dollars, I'm really sorry."
neu,Oh.  My name is Sean. Hi.
neu,"If you want, you can write a letter.  I can give you the address. Yes.  An angry--"
neu,"Or you can make a phone call.  But I think a letter might be a little more-- in my impression, letters have more..."
sad,No.
neu,That's sweet.
neu,Thank you.
sad,I went to see her headstone a week or two ago.
sad,"I used to go to cemeteries a lot before she died.  I just, you know, I felt like they were urban oasis, you know, there is always this green in the city."
sad,So I was like wandering around before.  It takes forever to find her headstone; I always lose it. You know.
sad,So I was looking at this other one and there was like a piece of candy there and I thought that I would take the candy and put it on her headstone.  And-
neu,"this woman came up and, you know, it was hers. It was her person that was there."
sad,"Yeah.  And she was like, that's pathetic, I hope you enjoy it."
sad,"And I, you know, I mean, I said I was sorry and I brought it back to her kind of and I like put it on the ground and she was like, no, it's fine.  She was like, I would rather have her back, honestly."
sad,"I don't know.  It just, like, I felt so bad because I shouldn't have done it.  I don't know.  Whatever."
sad,I don't know.
sad,At the cemetery?
sad,couple hours.
neu,"I brought- I brought Chuck with me. He went to Redlands, yeah, for the day.  We ran through the sprinklers."
neu,Yeah.  It's huge.  Redlands is an old city so they have lots and lots of stones.
neu,Yeah.
sad,"It's weird.  Whenever I go back to town, I think of her.  I mean, it's like ... I mean we grew up together and she died when we were twenty one.  And yeah.  She had cancer, she had two brain tumors."
sad,"My best friend Heather.  She's got a- we have a- we built this like little--  There's a park, Prospect Park.  And there is like a garden section of it that we set up for her."
sad,She used to have these poetry parties on Memorial Day.
sad,Umm. Yeah.
sad,"And the last time before she died, I remember she couldn't really stand, umm..."
sad,"But I mean she could, but it was- so it was kind of sitting at her feet holding her up and she had these poems she had memorized.  And I remember looking up, she had curly red hair and there was this palm tree right behind her and it was like a crown growing right out of her head.  It was cool."
sad,"Some, I guess.  She memorized this one, John Dunn, it's called, Death Be Not Proud. and-"
neu,"There's another one, I can't remember."
sad,"I remember, too, when we were--  she died at U.C.L.A.  She had brain surgery and there was not much hope to begin with, but I gave blood for her surgery, her mom and I before, so we dropped her off in the waiting room and then we were giving blood and came back.  And she, in her wheelchair, like can hardly do anything, reciting her poetry for these people like in the waiting room.  All she needs is a God damn audience.  You know?"
sad,"I'm sorry, Joy."
neu,Is there anything I can get you?  Do you want me to take care of anything for you or...?
neu,...pick up anything?
sad,You know you are welcome to stay at my house if you want to just check out for a couple days and hang out.
neu,Hmm.
neu,Oh.  She was there?
neu,Mmhmm.
sad,Yeah.
neu,How long were you there for?
neu,Mmhmm.
neu,Oh really?
neu,You ran through the sprinklers in the cemetery?
neu,Is it a big cemetery?
neu,"Oh, so they're like really old too, really old ones?"
neu,Mmhmm.
neu,Mmhmm.
neu,So she wrote a lot of poetry?
exc,"Yes.  There's a big envelope it says, you're in. I know."
exc,"I'm really excited.  Yeah. I don't know how I'm going to pay for anything, but... I also- Yeah.  Loans, too, yeah. I applied, though, for a bunch of grants and scholarships so I'm still waiting to hear on that."
exc,"Oh- I know, I know, I know, I know."
exc,"I don't know.  I spend so much time commuting as it is, I'd rather."
exc,I know. We should throw a party.
exc,Yeah.  I'm not sure.
exc,Umm...P.h.D. [LAUGHTER]
exc,So I get to mold young minds. Mrs.?  That's my mother.
exc,"I would be like- Oh. Right, right, right."
exc,"I know. I made such a mess of it, the entire time.  The last three things I've done, I've ruined everything, I think. Mm-hmm.  Yeah."
exc,Did you get the letter?
exc,Yeah. That is so awesome.
exc,Oh my God. What are you going to do? [LAUGHTER]
exc,"Oh-Yeah, I bet you're really excited. Oh.  That's what loans are for?  Right? Exactly."
exc,"Oh.  Good, good.  That's awesome. Are you going to stay around here?  Or are you going to like get a different neighborhood- you going to move to a different neighborhood?"
exc,This is so- I am so happy that you're going to stay.  You're not going to...We should totally throw a party.
exc,A rapper party ho. Yeah. Okay.
exc,"I am just- Yeah.  I'm sticking around, I'm just doing my thing.  I'm living here.  I'm so glad you're going to stay, I'm so glad you're going to be here. Yeah. Woo."
exc,Yeah.  Big time.
exc,Mmhmm. Mmhmm. Yay. So what major?  What are you doing?
neu,Is this a Masters or a P.h.D.?  Or can you...? Nice
neu,"That's good.  Don't you have to like teach a class, too, when you do that?"
exc,"Teacher. Mrs. Nash, I have a question."
exc,You have to get married.  Well you are married to Chuck.  You're Mrs. Nash.  Not to be confused with Mrs. Dash which is the popular seasoning.
exc,Yay...School's fun.
neu,"Of course, right.  That's where the real money is, being a student."
hap,That's how you get the big bucks.  Are you messing with the chair? Don't ruin it.
fru,What's he going to say?
neu,"He's dreaming of him again, walking around."
fru,What do you want to do?  Argue with him?
fru,You can't say that to him.
fru,Where's the proof?  Do you have any proof?
fru,"To you it is, to me it is, but to your father, you can talk yourself until you are blue in the face.  But there is no grave and there is no body, so where are you?"
fru,Why?
neu,"Well I got an idea, but what's your story?"
fru,"From your father's point of view, he is not dead and- Chris he still thinks he's still alive.  The girl is Larry's girl."
fru,"Now you can go on from there if you know where to go, but I'm telling you, I don't know where to go."
fru,"You're a considerate fellow, there's nothing wrong in that."
fru,I just don't see why.  Have you asked Annie yet?
fru,Well how do you know she's going to marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way your father does.
fru,The trouble is you don't see enough women.  You never did.
fru,Why does it have to be Annie?
fru,Oh that's a great reason.  It's no reason at all.
fru,"You haven't seen her since you went away to war, it's been five years."
fru,I don't want a diagram.
fru,He thinks he's coming back Chris.
fru,"You marry that girl, you are pronouncing him dead..."
fru,...and then what's that going to do to your father?  Do you know?  I don't.
neu,Just give it some more thought.
ang,What the hell is this?
ang,You have a business here.  What the hell is this?
ang,Oh.  Must you be inspired?
fru,You mean to tell me that you would leave the business over this?
fru,Well you don't want to think like that.
ang,"All right.  But you don't want to think like that because what the hell are we working for, Chris?  It's all for you.  This whole shooting match is for you."
ang,Just don't think like that.
fru,"I don't understand you, do I?"
fru,I can see that.
neu,He saw it.
neu,He was out here when it broke.
neu,Four o clock this morning.  I heard a crack and I woke up and looked out.  He was standing right over there when it cracked.
neu,I don't know.
neu,I guess he is.
fru,"I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know one thing, Mom, you've made a terrible mistake with father."
neu,You know Larry is not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?
fru,I don't want to argue but it's time he realized that nobody believes Larry is alive.
fru,"You know?  Why shouldn't he walk the nights thinking of him, dreaming of him?   Do we contradict him?  Do we say, we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had any hope for years now?"
neu,We've got to say it to him.
fru,"For God's sake, three years?  Nobody comes back after three years; that's insane."
neu,"Sit down, Mom.  I want to talk to you."
fru,"All right, all right, all right.  You know why I asked Annie here, right?"
neu,You know.
neu,I'm going to ask her to marry me.
neu,You know it's not just my business.
neu,"So all right then, I'll just go ahead with it?"
fru,Then it's not just my business.
ang,"You know sometimes you infuriate me.  you know that?  Isn't it your business if I tell father and he throws a fit about it?  God, you have such a talent for ignoring things."
fru,She's not Larry's girl.
fru,"I don't know why it is, but every time I reach out for something I have to pull back because I am afraid other people will suffer. My whole bloody life, time after time."
fru,To hell with that.
neu,I wanted to get this settled first.
neu,"Well if she does, then that's it.  That's the end of it.  From her letters, though, I think she's pretty much forgotten him."
neu,And then we'll thrash it out with father.  Okay Mom?  Don't avoid me.
fru,So what.  I'm not fast with women.
fru,Because it is.
fru,I don't know.
fru,"I can't help it, I know her best.  I was brought up next door to her, you know?  These years when I think of someone for my wife, I think of Annie."
fru,"Mom, what do you want?  A diagram?"
fru,"All right, then, Mom. [BREATHING]"
fru,"I've given it three years of thought.  And I'd hope that if I waited, father would forget about Larry and then we could just have a regular wedding and everyone would be happy."
fru,"But if I can't do that here, I may have to go somewhere else."
neu,"I'll get out.  I'll get married and I'll move somewhere else, maybe New York."
fru,"I've been a good son for too long, a good sucker."
fru,The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.
fru,"Yes.  I like it for an hour a day.  I don't care if I have to grub for money all day long, when I come home I want it happy."
fru,"I want some kids, I want a family, I want somebody that I can give myself to and Annie is in the center of that.  Now it's just where to find it."
neu,"On this, I would."
neu,Then help me stay here.
fru,I know that.  Then just help me stay here.
fru,Well I am thinking like that.
fru,No.  You don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.
ang,He's not going to marry her.
ang,It's got that about it.
ang,"What is going on here, Joe?"
ang,She is not his girl.  She knows she's not.
ang,"Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men, why is she still single?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she waited."
ang,"Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my darkest moments, I think of her waiting and I know that I'm right."
ang,"Nobody in this house dares take away her faith, Joe.  You know strangers might, but not his father, not his brother."
ang,"I want you to-- I want you to act like he is coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since Chris invited her here."
ang,I won't stand for any nonsense.
ang,"Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.  Oh laugh, laugh all you like but why does this happen the very night he comes back.  She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it, Joe, look."
ang,"Just believe with me, Joe. Only last week a man came back in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  Believe with me. You, above all, have got to believe. Just believe."
fru,I can't help it.
neu,Well maybe...maybe he just wanted to see her.
fru,[BREATHING] You don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anything more than he told you.
neu,How do you know he's even thinking about it?
fru,Now listen.
fru,You can't read her mind.
neu,How do you know why she waited?
fru,"Hey look, it's a nice day, huh?  Why are we arguing?"
fru,What do you want me to do? What do you want?
fru,Kate.
fru,[BREATHING]
fru,Calm yourself.
fru,Okay. Calm yourself.
fru,"I know. All right, all right. All right. Okay.  Calm yourself. What does that mean, me above all?"
ang,"What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?"
neu,You're the only one who still loves his parents.
neu,It's not so bad; it's a good thing.
neu,"[BREATHING] You know, it's lovely here.  The air is sweet."
neu,"I'm not sorry, no. But I'm...I can't stay."
neu,"For one thing, your mother much as told me to go."
neu,"And then, you.  You've been kind of..."
neu,Sort of embarrassed ever since I got here.
neu,I knew they would.
neu,"Well sure, from your mother's point of view.  Why else would I come?"
neu,"I, umm. I guess, I guess that's kind of why I came."
hap,[BREATHING]
hap,[LAUGHTER]
hap,[LAUGHTER]
hap,No. No
neu,"Chris, I've been ready a long, long, time."
neu,I almost got married two years ago.
neu,You started to write me.
hap,Every day since.
hap,beating around the bush.
hap,"I will never forgive you.  All I'd done was sit around wondering if I was crazy waiting so long, wondering if you were thinking about me."
hap,Not like that you're not.
neu,"Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris."
neu,"Yeah, sure."
neu,How many?
sad,"Aw, geez."
neu,Mmhmm.
hap,What would I do with a fortune?
neu,"I know.  It kind of went out of style, didn't it?"
neu,You're not sorry you came.
neu,Well.
neu,What?
neu,Well I was kind of planning of sneaking up on you over the course of a week or so.  They just take it for granted that we're all set.
hap,"I love you. Annie, I love you."
hap,"I don't really have any imagination, that's all I know how to say."
hap,"Am I embarrassing you? Are you - See, I didn't want to do it here with this yard, on this porch.  I wanted it to be somewhere new, some place fresh for both of us."
hap,Why didn't you let me know?
hap,Give me a...
hap,Give me a kiss.
hap,"Oh Annie, we are going to live now.  I am going to make you so happy."
hap,I kissed you.
sad,"Hey, let's drive some place.  Huh?  Let's get out of here."
sad,No it's nothing like that. It's-
sad,Yeah.  I suppose I have been. But it's going from me.
sad,I don't even know how to start.
sad,"It's just all mixed up with so many other things, you know?  You know overseas I was in command of a company?"
sad,Well I lost them.
sad,Pretty much all.
sad,You can't just toss off a thing like that because they weren't just men. You know?
sad,"Like for instance, there was this one time it had been raining for several days and this kid he just came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks.  He just put them in my pocket.  That's a little thing, you know, but that's what kind of guys I had."
sad,"They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that, exactly.  Just a little more selfish and they would all be here today."
sad,"To bring that on to the earth again, you know, is like some kind of monument and I thought I would just make a difference to them."
sad,"But then I came home and it was incredible, you know?  The whole thing was just kind of this random bus accident.  You know, I went back to the rat race again, I went to work."
sad,And I didn't want any of it. I guess that included you.
neu,I just want you to know Annie.
neu,Fine.
fru,[BREATHING]
neu,That's not your flashlight.
ang,You keep saying my flashlight like it's just yours.
ang,How's that supposed to make me feel?
neu,Yeah.
hap,[LAUGHTER]
sad,I'm cold.
fru,"Well, then let's go."
neu,Not particularly.
fru,"Pass what up?  I mean these fish swim out of the ocean, they flop around on the beach, they swim away and then they die."
fru,Oh Augie
fru,Yeah.
fru,Hmm.  We didn't see them the year before either.
neu,That's the wind.
neu,About what?
exc,"Okay.  Is that, is that--"
neu,"The flashlight, the silver one.  There's only one, isn't there?"
neu,Whose is it?
neu,"Oh...well. Yeah, of course."
neu,No.
neu,"Of course, our flashlight.  What's yours is mine.  Me flashlight es su flashlight."
fru,"Naturally.  God, how could we not think to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out, though."
neu,Do they always run during a full moon?  I don't remember.  Was it full last year?
neu,"Huh.  Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  No?  you know, we should have brought the blanket?  Our blanket."
neu,"Aw.  Do you know, I should have brought a six pack, too.  A six pack, that would be just the ticket right about now.  Huh?"
exc,"God, I'm so excited, I'm like a kid.  I can't believe I got out of the house with my fly zipped up."
fru,Do you want my jacket?
neu,Right.
neu,"Wait, that's my point, too."
fru,"No, no.  Okay.  That's not my point.  My point is there is no point in coming down here if we just turn around and go home.  Don't you want to see it?"
neu,Why not?
neu,"Honey, this is like a natural phenomenon. I mean... People in Kansas would have to get plane reservations and get hotel rooms to see this.  It's just forty minutes away for us; it's too good to pass up."
neu,Yeah.  But this..this moment on the beach is like the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping around is laying eggs or what to do - spawning or mating or whatever.
neu,This is a big night for these little guys.  It's like life's last orgy.
fru,Yeah they do.
neu,"There's like mystery here, there's magic.  It's like a little bit of the unexplainable.  I just can't see how you're not interested."
neu,"God, I don't get it.  you know the first time we came here, you said it was the best night of your life?"
neu,"And last year, I remember distinctly you said, you were so excited to get here that you don't remember you stubbed your toe until we were in the car."
neu,Ahh...we weren't in a good spot.
neu,"We just weren't in a good spot.  I'm telling you, this is a much better spot.  I have instincts for these things."
exc,"Look there, see?  What's that?  No, that's - that's just seaweed."
hap,"God, this is great.  Think about this.  I know you are not interested, but just think about this."
exc,"Just all at once, they turned and they formed this line as long as the California coast.  And some instinctual little firecracker went off in their bodies and they all just turned as one and started swimming."
exc,It's single mindedness with no mind.  It is urgency that is just pure urge.
hap,So what do you think?
hap,"About all of that, about all I was talking about."
neu,That's the wind.
neu,About what?
ang,"Don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that, you always ask me that.  It's insulting."
fru,We just have different ideas of what this night is supposed to look like.
ang,"For God- Grow up, Augie.  The fish are not going to arrive."
ang,Because they never do.  Have they...Have they ever?
ang,Twice is every time we have tried; that's ever.
fru,I feel like my whole life is going to be spent standing on this beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for fish to show up.  And the fish never show up.
fru,You don't understand anything I am saying.
sad,"I feel like I'm always just standing here waiting.  I feel like this night is going to be the night, but it never is."
ang,"For God's sake, this is not about fish."
neu,Do you remember the first year we came here?  It was like four years after we got married.
hap,"You whispered the sweetest, most intimate things to me right into my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them.  And I remember thinking, this is it.  You know, finally, I am as happy as I'm supposed to be."
fru,dancing barefoot in the sand.
sad,I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.
neu,No.
fru,"No, no. Nothing."
neu,No.
fru,No.
fru,[BREATHING]
fru,This? What is this?  This is nothing.  This isn't even anything.
fru,"I mean this is a lot of things, but it's just..."
fru,Do you understand what I am saying?
sad,"I know you are Augie, I know."
sad,"I know you meant this to be special, I know that you wanted it to be right, but I just can't help thinking that, I can't help wishing that I was somewhere else."
sad,I didn't say that.
sad,"You're the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else.  Somebody who doesn't take things so seriously, who could enjoy herself."
neu,"So maybe we are in the wrong spot, but we are with the right person."
hap,"Hmm.  I noticed that, it's pretty. Big old white moon."
hap,"Augie, you bought refreshments."
hap,I guess we don't need glasses.
hap,I'm beginning to think this might be the right spot after all.
sad,"Augie, I'm sorry."
neu,Or not.
exc,"Look at this, all of the hairs are standing up on my arm."
exc,"Well, so, what do you think?"
neu,About what I was saying.
fru,"Not just me, look at all of these people."
neu,"Carla, can I ask you something?  Now, don't take this the wrong way, but are you on your period?"
fru,"Well then, what's bugging you?"
fru,"There is nothing to it; we come down here, the fish arrive, they flop around, they do their fish thing.  We go ooh, ah, look at the fish and we go home."
fru,Why not?
fru,We've missed them twice.
fru,They'll show up this time.
fru,No. Of course not.
fru,"It's just fish, it's nothing to get traumatized over."
fru,Okay.  I'm trying to work this backwards and pinpoint the exact moment where we took a turn for the worst here.
neu,"Okay.  So you were fine during that phone call from Marge and then dinner was okay.  And doing the dishes was fine and then I was going to take a shower and you're watching the news and you said the grunions are running tonight, do you want to go?  And I said, sure great, let's go."
neu,"Okay.  So I am putting out the pets, getting the car out of the garage."
neu,"It's when we were driving past that Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, let's get some champagne.  I said no, time's a wasting or something like that."
fru,"That's what it is?  Right?  You want this to be like the other time, right?"
neu,Sure.  All right.  Okay.
neu,"Listen, do you want to dance?"
neu,Do you want me to go get some champagne?
hap,Do you want to take off your shoes?
hap,Do you want to get married again?
fru,"No I'm just like you.  I thought it was going to be all roses and peaches and the bills would just pay themselves.  And we'll have three, fat rosy cheeked children.  Huh, baby, the joke's on us.  Because you know what you get?"
fru,Do you know what you get?  You get this.
neu,Yes it is.
fru,[BREATHING]
fru,I'm doing the best I can.
sad,"Maybe if you were with someone else, too."
sad,I just- I know I don't make you happy.
neu,"You know, actually now that you mention it, no I don't."
fru,"I don't know, it seemed like such a good spot to me."
neu,"We have a great view of the moon from here, though, huh?"
neu,[BREATHING]
hap,And look what I got here.
hap,[BREATHING]
neu,Do you want to go home?  Are you cold?
neu,"Shh.  If we're very quiet, the fish might come."
hap,Or not.
hap,[LAUGHTER] That sent shivers up my spine.
exc,We'll behave exquisitely.
exc,I think I shall do a curtsy.
hap,Yes.  Meaning just that.
hap,Don't laugh at me.  I'm being serious.
exc,Who's they?
hap,[LAUGHTER]
hap,"Oh Elliott, worms don't pop."
hap,"Aw.  Thank you, darling.  The same applies to you too, except that if you so much as look at another woman I'll kill you."
exc,"Oh Charles, that was his name.  He did wiggle so beautifully."
hap,"The manager came in, he found us rolling about the floor, biting and scratching like panthers. [LAUGHTER]  How utterly, utterly ridiculous."
hap,[LAUGHTER] And very much sillier.
exc,I don't care then.
hap,No.  Wrong number. [LAUGHTER]
hap,What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us.[LAUGHTER]
hap,With perfect poise.
hap,"It's strange; things that ought to matter dreadfully, they just don't matter at all when one's happy.  Do they?"
hap,"Well what does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?"
hap,Who knows?
exc,Yes.  Yes with all of his might.
exc,"Let's be superficial, and just pity those poor philosophers, huh?  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party for as long as we can, you know, like small, idiotic school children."
hap,Oh Come and kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop out of your eye sockets.
hap,"Oh See, I don't care what you do, see.  You can paint yourself green and run naked through the Place Vendome and run off with all of the men of the world.  I shan't say a word, just as long as you love me best."
hap,"That was a rouser, wasn't it?"
hap,[LAUGHTER] I'll never forget his face. [LAUGHTER]
hap,[LAUGHTER] We were very much younger then.
hap,And very much sillier.
hap,Oh.  You knew there was nothing in that.
hap,"Presents?  It was only a trivial, little brooch."
neu,I did not.  You worked that whole thing up in your jealous imagination.
neu,"Well, what of it?"
fru,Oh dear.  I'm bored with this conversation.
ang,Don't be stupid.
ang,What?
ang,No.  I am just making myself fascinating for you.
ang,Oh.  It's a woman's duty to allure the man.
ang,No it isn't.
ang,You shut up.
ang,They sting. I don't care.  Do you understand?  I don't care if they bark and they roll about like hoops.
ang,"Yes I did, quite a lot."
ang,Mind your own business.
ang,"You're quite insufferable, I expect it's because you are drunk."
ang,You've always had a weak head.
ang,"On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy."
ang,Oh shut up.
ang,Shut up.
ang,"Not very funny, darling.  Why don't you have some more brandy."
neu,Why?
neu,There are no people upstairs; it's a photographer's studio.
neu,They are away in Tunis.
ang,Fine if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.
ang,"You are far too temperamental, try to control yourself."
ang,"I won't.  Let go, let go of me. Listen, listen?  I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully."
ang,"Oh shut up.  Let go.  I hate you, I hate you.  Do you hear?  You are a conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible."
ang,This is the end.  Do you hear me?  Finally and forever.
ang,Oh.  Yes I am.
ang,"Yes I am.   Stop it. Stop it.  Let go of me. Oh.  You're a cruel fiend.  I loathe and I hate you. Marry you again?  Never, never, never. I hope you die in torment, you brute beast cad."
neu,However I believe the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.
neu,I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.
neu,You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.
fru,"Well, you let him kiss you, huh?  You said you did."
ang,What about me?
fru,So am I.  I'm bored stiff. [GARBAGE]  Do you want some brandy?
neu,"I'll have a little, I think."
neu,"No particular reason.  Anyhow, they are very small ones."
fru,"You can hardly call three glasses of liquor a whole evening long, going on and on and on."
fru,Oh.  Don't be so grand.  Just because you don't happen to want one at the moment.
ang,"Really, Amanda."
fru,Nothing.
neu,"you going out somewhere, dear?"
neu,"Well as a matter of fact, yes, that's perfectly true."
neu,Yes it is.
ang,"Oh really.  It's a pity you didn't have any brandy, it would have made you a little less disagreeable."
ang,"Snap, snap, snap.  You know you are like a little adder."
ang,Nonsense.  They have a bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap. They snap.
ang,Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?
ang,"And I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more than, too. Yes.  I suppose you guys had a riotous time, huh?  All out, no restraint at all.  Well, you never really had much anyhow."
ang,I think I am not in the least bit drunk.
ang,I think I mentioned once before that I've had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long.  A child of two cannot get drunk on that.
ang,"That's very interesting Amanda. How about a child of four?  Or a child of six?  Or a child of nine? We can get a good little conversation going on about this, you know, intemperate tots."
ang,"Look, you better turn that off. I don't want to wake up the people upstairs."
ang,Well then you'll wake up the people downstairs.
neu,This is no time of year for Tunis.
ang,I will do no such thing.
ang,"Will you turn that off, it's driving me mad."
ang,Turn it off.
ang,"Amanda, listen, listen."
ang,Oh.  That's very amusing indeed.
ang,"You are a vile, ill-tempered, loose living, wicked little beast and I never want to see you again as long as I live."
ang,You're not going like this.
ang,You're not.
ang,"Shut up. Shut up. God, I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling back to me on a bended knee.  You are a vile, ill-tempered, mean little wench and I never want to see you again as long as I live."
ang,Next.
ang,My window is open.
fru,What are you... what's...What are you applying for?
ang,"No, I need your ID to give you a second ID."
ang,It's really simple if you have a problem with it... Maybe you should--
fru,You have a birth certificate?
ang,What do you expect me to do?
ang,Probably.
fru,I am..I don't..I don't understand what you want.  A driver's license or a California ID.
ang,Don't raise your voice with me.
ang,Don't talk to me like I'm a child.
ang,Do you know how long I've been working here? How long have you lived in California?
ang,"Maybe you never been to the D.M.V. before, maybe you should get back in line.  You know what?  sit in line again and if you get my number ask for different one."
neu,Uh huh.  I didn't come here get in yelling match either.
neu,They don't pay me enough to deal people like you.
fru,"Yes, me. Okay, okay here we go."
fru,"Okay, so filled out all these forms  --"
fru,and I have This form of ID here so...
neu,"Yes, Jones."
fru,I'm just applying for another ID.
fru,"Yes.  I'm supposed to have three forms of ID for this.  It's a long story, I'm supposed to have three forms of ID for this other job I really don't get into but I need another..."
fru,"I have it right here, yes."
fru,But that's...
fru,"That's why I'm here, that's why I was waiting in this line.  I need to get another form of ID."
neu,"No, I don't have a passport."
fru,"I don't where it is though, I don't have with me.  Can I get it from somewhere?  I mean..."
fru,I probably have to go wait another line to get my birth certificate don't I?
fru,You're very helpful.  What's your name?
fru,So can you help me or not?
fru,Okay. [BREATHING]
fru,I need California ID.
fru,On top of these other two forms of ID which I already have.
fru,"No, I don't have driver's license."
ang,Did you even look at the form?  I filled it out all these questions--
fru,Okay.
fru,If it makes you stop acting like a child.
ang,I am not...I'm not getting to back that line.
fru,"Okay, okay let's keep our voices down, okay?  I didn't come here to get in yelling match."
fru,"I did not come in here to get in a yelling match with you, all right?"
fru,Just try and help me.
ang,Why?
ang,"Why, because I'm sick of talking to you."
ang,"'Cause you're obviously not talking to me, you're just yelling at me, berating me and telling me I can't fill out forms right."
fru,"Oh, no honey. And you're going to miss the Christmas card too. It's a shame. It's going to be a good, nice picture."
neu,What's happening?
fru,How...
fru,How can they do that?
fru,They said you're home for at least four years.
fru,[BREATHING]
fru,That's not fair.
fru,[BREATHING]
sad,I don't even know what to tell you.
sad,What about the birthday party?
sad,You're going with the same ones?
sad,It's not the same though.
sad,Mm hmm.  We'll build a bunker and never come out.
sad,Don't say that.
neu,"Hey, Joy come in here."
sad,I have to go back.
sad,I just got a letter I have to go back.
sad,First thing tomorrow morning.
fru,"I guess they can do it,"
sad,"The National Guard is I guess really spread thin and then everyone has to go.  We all have to go back, my whole companies going back."
sad,"So yeah, we leave tomorrow..."
sad,...we're all shipping out.
sad,I just got I feel like I'm in shock actually.
sad,I don't know.
sad,I guess you're just going to have to have it without me.
sad,"Hey listen, it's going to be okay though, all right?"
sad,You're going to be fine.
sad,"I'm going to be fine too, okay?"
sad,I know I have a good... I have a really good group of guys with me.
sad,We're going to be okay.
sad,Do promise me you're going to take a lot of pictures.
sad,I know.
sad,I just wish there was something I could do.
sad,Run away?
sad,"I really don't want to go, I don't want to go..."
sad,I love you.
exc,Why?
exc,Is she on the run?
exc,"Oh, she just needs to marry you."
exc,That's incredible. That's awesome. Where's she from?  Maybe you can get a dual citizenship.

exc,"Yeah. Yeah. And then yeah, and then you know like you could like you could do like like sock her for a lot of money"
exc,"Like make her rent the apartment that you two have to live together in, you know. And you won't pay any rent or you pay like, a hundred bucks a month or something."
exc,Yeah.
exc,"Dude, you lucked out."

exc,"Oh, totally. Yeah."
exc,The craziest thing just happened to me.
exc,This girl; she just offered me fifty thousand dollars to marry her.

exc,"No, no, no, no, no, no she just... she's not a citizen but she wants her visa, yeah. She's going to pay me fifty thousand dollars to marry her and stay married to her for two years."
exc,That's like twenty five thousand dollar a year for doing nothing. Isn't that awesome?
neu,"She's actually from England, I think.  Well she- she spoke English but she had an accent. I didn't even ask."
exc,"Fifty thousand dollars. Fifty thousand dollars. I was just out... I just... she's - well, she's a friend of friend but like..."

neu,"I don't know just sometimes you get kind of... No, I'm not saying that.  I just--"
neu,...has anyone ever just said anything like that to you before?

neu,I just don't want you to fly off the handle.
neu,You kind of have a short fuse.
neu,Yeah.
neu,"Like this, right now we're trying have a conversation."
neu,We're trying to have a conversation and you seem extremely hostile. You keep cutting me off.
neu,I can't finish the sentence with you without you jumping in...
neu,...and you're always right.
neu,You have an excuse for everything.
neu,I'm just saying that maybe you should take in some information before you produce more of your own.
neu,[BREATHING]
fru,That's -.
neu,"Well, what kind of field are you looking to go into?"
fru,It's--I've been trying to find this job I can't get any job.
fru,It's not fair.
fru,"I mean I've been looking for a job for like three years and I can't get a job.  I mean like, it's America, right?  I should be able to get a job."
fru,"I guess.  But three years?  I mean, I like--I went to college even, I mean I didn't finish but I went for like a little bit.  It's not fair, I don't know."
fru,"I mean I've been sending out my resumes and doing everything I can do but nothing is happening.  You know, it's like I can't and I can't keep living on loans anymore like this.  I'm going to--I mean eventually I'm going to have to pay it back. I'm just kind of freaking out, I don't know."
fru,"No, well maybe it's because I'm like frustrated 'cause I can't get a job, you know."
fru,"Like it's really hard to like shake that off when you go into like audition a room or whatever, you know what I mean?"
fru,"I guess I just getting really hard to fake, you know."
fru,"Are you hiring? Wait, do you know of a job? Seriously, do you know, like do you know of anything though?  Like, oh please, do you know of anything?"
fru,Yeah.
fru,I come across angry?
ang,What?
fru,"Okay.  You're my friend you can tell me stuff.  You can tell me honestly stuff, okay?  Please."
fru,"Okay, I'm not flying off the handle I don't think I'm flying off the handle here at all."
fru,I have a short fuse?
ang,"Okay. Okay no, no, no, no okay no, I need to hear this more. Come on, bring it."
fru,I'm not always right I'm just--

ang,I'm like a sponge I'm like soaked up with all this information for like three years I'm just dying for a job to like put it in to.
fru,"You know, and like I don't think it's that much to ask. I know."
neu,That's it.
neu,Can I help you?
neu,I need a little more information.
neu,What- What flight did you come in on?
neu,Georgia?
neu,"There's no need for you to raise your voice, sir."
neu,I've been college educated.
neu,I speak your language.
neu,I'm just saying you don't need to talk to me like I-
fru,I'm not a child.
neu,"Details, Details.  Well, anyhow can I--"
neu,so you flew in from Atlanta...
neu,Four...Four hours ago.
neu,Do you have any i-?
neu,I wouldn't let you?   I was not in Atlanta. I was not in Atlanta.
neu,I had nothing to do with the boarding attendance.  I'm sorry that your seat was wherever it was.
neu,"I have some unfortunate news, uh, that your bag isn't going to be--"
neu,#NAME?
neu,I'm really sorry to tell you this but...
neu,It's not.  I can offer you fifty dollars and a reimbursement gift cards for our airline...
neu,...and your future...
neu,No.
neu,Yes.
neu,We've actually...
neu,They do as matter of fact.  We don't like to publicize it because
neu,people wouldn't Fly our airline.
neu,What was that?
neu,That's unfortunate.
neu,That's too bad.
neu,I wish I could give it to you.
neu,I wish I-
neu,That's not - no.
neu,No.
neu,We have plenty of aggressive searching going on it's not there.  Someone's taken it.
fru,You know I don't need to take this sort of abuse.
fru,"Yes, please help me.  Where is my bag?"
fru,"Where is my bag?  Come on, I've been here for four hours."
fru,"Okay, I'm coming in from Atlanta."
ang,Are you insinuating that I don't have a college education and that- for some reason that makes you a better person than I am?
ang,"Listen, shut your smug mouth, okay?  I don't need that."
ang,I've been sitting here for four hours.
ang,You people have just been tossing me around like a used hanky.
ang,You work here.
fru,My bag from Atlanta.
fru,It's a little black bag with wheels.
neu,Okay.
fru,Where is it?  Where did it go?
ang,Probably people that work for your company huh?
ang,Do you know what was in that little bag that I could have just easily put in overhead compartment but no I had to check?
ang,My computer which has all of my data which I'm collecting right now.
ang,Yeah it's really unfortunate you know why because I'm going to get fired if I don't get that.  So I need to have that back.
ang,"Fifty dollars is not going to cover me for my job, okay?"
ang,Well you need to find it. Can I just go back there and look through the bags?  Can I just go back there and just go through maybe I'll find it.
ang,It'll be a lot more than what you're doing sitting here and just give me lip service.  I'd like to go back at least do some aggressive searching for my stuff.
ang,"Sure, yeah right you have plenty of aggressive searching going on, aggressive searching, drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes."
ang,I know what you guys do when you're not working you're union people; you just sit around on your ass.
fru,[BREATHING]
ang,Thank you very much.
neu,You okay?

neu,Are there things you wish you'd done differently?
sad,"Yeah, I'm just-- yeah"

sad,You didn't even hear?
sad,[BREATHING] Umm.
sad,God I've told this story so many times. Umm.
sad,I just...I just basically lost someone that was really close to me.
sad,"And I've kind of been dealing with all of the...the stuff, you know the hospital and people work because..."
sad,"He kind of didn't have anyone to take care of that for him, so--"
sad,It's just really...really messed up.
sad,No.
sad,Just like it.
sad,"No, I mean it just came on really quick, you know I mean it was a [GARBAGE] it was a sickness but it just --"
sad,What?
sad,"He was sick. He got sick. He got sick but it happened really, really fast, you know."
sad,It was kind of like boom... done
sad,It's just really weird because he was really young you know and it kind of like...
sad,#NAME?
sad,So weird you know that like one days it's like you know sounds so stupid but like one day someone's here. And like next day you know they're not here and it just kind of makes you like think about like life and mortality and like that kind of stuff.  You just like used to take for granted--you know.
sad,"Exactly, you know, and like he had so many plans and he was going to do..."
sad,"so many things, you know?"
sad,What?
sad,Yeah.
sad,"He was a really, really good guy."
sad,A lot of people loved him.
sad,"You know, it's like affecting a lot of people it's not just me, you know?"
sad,Umm...
sad,For like eight years.
sad,Yeah.
sad,"Yeah, I'm glad I was there. Glad I- glad I got to be there."
sad,"So weird,"
sad,"like I can't...it's like you know it's like ""pinch me"" it's like I can't believe like I'm dealing with this, you know."
neu,Yeah.
exc,[LAUGHTER]. For softball? That's unbelievable. Is it slow pitch?
exc,Pinch hitting softball.
exc,That is incredible.
exc,That's amazing. They pay for everything?
exc,"Your housing, books, everything? That is incredible."
exc,That is incredible. Do you get like a per diem?
exc,You should...You should look into that.
exc,"That is amazing, congratulations. Good for you."
neu,Oh.
exc,"Yeah, that you probably. You should see one of these Victorian houses around by."
neu,Oh. Venice beach.
exc,"Oh, you don't like that. You're west-sider?"
exc,"Okay. That would be way too much of a commute you can't do that. Especially- I know especially from--I don't know, what I was going to say, I don't know."
exc,I don't know. Commuting from what Malibu that would be ridiculous.
exc,Oh yeah. He'd drop you right off at practice?
exc,They have those neon--softballs.  They're like day-glow you can see them anywhere.
neu,Oh. That is incredible. Is it--
exc,"do they have a--is it a co-ed softball team?  I mean... Really? You know, I didn't even know that they have that."
exc,Who do you play? Like do--are you like... nationally ranked?
exc,That is unbelievable.
exc,I would put that right up there with--ping-pong.
exc,I mean not to denigrate what you are doing.  I think that's great.
exc,"No, no.  I love softball. I played softball all the time."
exc,I am not saying you should be. I'm not no. I think it's great I think you should be incredibly proud yourself especially because you're going to U.S.C for free for doing it. For free.
hap,You're like the rookie? The new kid.
hap,Just watch in five years you'll be like on the force. You carry around donuts in your back pocket... [LAUGHTER]
exc,Check this out.  You know how I've told you I've been really into like softball recently?
exc,"Well, this is totally random, I got this full ride scholarship to go to U.S.C next year to play softball."
exc,For softball.  They're going to pay me to go to school. Isn't that awesome?
exc,"Yeah.  Well, I don't--well yeah I can pitch, I'm not like the pitcher though. I'm like the pinch hitter guy I mostly just hit.  But I guess I'm going to have to... Yeah, and then I play shortstop too but... It's so ex- The good news is I get to stay here."
exc,"I know. For softball, yeah."
exc,"Yeah, everything. Every like- free ride and I get to, you know, like be on like a Trojans sports team too. And it's like cool. Isn't it awesome?"
hap,"I don't know. I should ask. Yeah, I will."
exc,Thank you.
exc,But I don't know I want to live in the housing that they give me though 'cause I think I want to you know like get like a nicer place.
exc,Where should I move?
exc,"That's a really good idea. Or I could go to like Santa Monica. Go beach. Venice beach, yeah a little dirty though. I don't want to go to Venice beach. But - Malibu. All right."
hap,Professional softball player Malibu. [LAUGHTER]
hap,"Oh yeah, that would be.  Well, depends on what type of car you had, though too. I guess it would be worth it. helicopter. Yeah, helicopter.  There is a helipad there, right? Yeah, exactly."
hap,They do it's--believe me it's huge.
exc,I just got into it. I just kind of fell into it. Literally I was walking around and...
hap,It's pretty wild.
neu,"Yeah, well I doubt [GARBAGE] ping pong [GARBAGE]"
exc,For free that's really what it's about. I mean who cares I mean if I have to play softball all the time?
neu,Yeah we have like away games and stuff.
neu,But you know I'm like [GARBAGE].
hap,I'm going to have a mustache...On the force...
hap,Pull over..
fru,What he's going to say?
sad,Did you talk to him?
sad,Cried hard?
sad,[BREATHING]
fru,What is he doing out here at that hour?
ang,"He's dreaming about him again, walking the streets."
ang,What do you mean a mistake?
fru,"What do you want to do, argue with him?"
ang,"What, can you prove it?  What proof do you have?  Can you prove it?"
ang,"To you it is, to me it is.  But to your father?  You can talk yourself 'til you're blue in the face but there's was no grave and there is no body.  So where are you?"
ang,The trouble is those god damn news papers.  Every month some boy comes back missing longer then Larry so--
ang,Why?
fru,"Well, that's only your business, Chris."
ang,"Well, what do you want me to do?  You're old enough known your own business."
fru,I'm just saying.
ang,I'm sorry.  I ignore what I've got to ignore. That girl is Larry's girl.
ang,"From father's point of view he is not dead and you have no right to take his girl.  I'm just saying that you can go on from there if you know where to go but I'm saying I don't know where to go.  See, I don't know."
neu,You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong in that.
neu,Did you ask Annie yet?
fru,"Well, how do you know she's going to marry you?  Maybe she feels same way your father does."
fru,"The trouble is you don't see enough women, you never did."
ang,I don't see why it has to be Annie.
ang,"That's a good answer but it doesn't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you went away to war, it's been five years."
sad,"He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl you're pronouncing him dead."
ang,"Do you know what that'll do to you, to your father, do you know?  I don't."
ang,Are you crazy?
ang,You have a business here.  I said what the hell is this?
ang,"Oh, must you be inspired."
ang,"Well, you don't want to think like that."
ang,"All right but you don't think like that because what the hell is this all for.  This is all for you, what are we working for Chris? The whole shooting match is for you."
ang,"Well, you don't think like that."
ang,"I don't understand you, do I?"
ang,"Well, I can see that."
neu,He saw it.
neu,I was out here at four this morning I heard a crack and I looked out the window and he was standing right over there.
sad,I don't know.  But he went back in the kitchen and he cried.
sad,No.  I figured I'd just let it wait.
sad,"Yeah, I could hear him crying through the floorboards in my room."
sad,I don't know.
sad,I guess he is.
fru,I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know we've made terrible mistake with father.
fru,"I just--why shouldn't he walk the nights waiting for him, huh?  Do we contradict him do we say we don't have any hope any more that he's not coming back?"
fru,"I don't want to argue with him, it's just for God's sake it's time he realized that no one believes with him any more."
fru,I got to.
fru,"For God's sake, three years?  Nobody comes back after three years. It's insane."
fru,"Okay, all right.  Mom, sit down.  I want to talk to you."
fru,"Yeah, okay all right, all right.  Listen, um, you know why I asked Annie here, right?"
neu,I'm going to ask her to marry me.
fru,You know it's not just my business.
fru,So it's okay then?  I'm just going to go ahead with it?
ang,"See.  Then it's not just my business. Sometimes you infuriate me, you know that?  You know it's just your business too if I tell father and he throws a fit about it, huh?"
ang,She is not Larry's girl.
fru,I don't know why it is you know every time I reach out for something I have to pull back 'cause I'm afraid it's going to hurt somebody.  All my life...
ang,To hell with that.
sad,"No, I wanted to get this all sorted out first."
fru,So what?  I'm just--I'm not fast with women.
fru,Because it is.
fru,"I don't know, it I think of her, I grew up next to her.  She is what I think of when I think of a wife."
fru,I've given it lots of thought.  And I keep coming back to the same thing.
fru,"When I think of a family, when I think of my future I see Annie in the center of that and you know and if that can't happen here then I'll go somewhere else."
fru,I'll leave.  I'll get married and move somewhere else maybe New York.
ang,Business?  The business doesn't inspire me.
ang,"Yes, yes I like it for one hour a day.  I don't care if I have to grub for money all day long when I come home I want it nice, I want a family, I want to kids and Annie is in the center of that."
fru,If that can't happen here...
neu,"Yes, on this I would."
sad,Then help me stay here mom.
sad,Then help me stay.
ang,I am thinking like that.
sad,"No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy."
ang,Why did he invite her here?
ang,It's been three and a half years.  Why all of a sudden?
ang,"What is going on here, Joe?"
ang,The girl is not Larry's.  If the girl is Larry's girl she's not his she know she's not.
fru,"Nobody in this house dares take away her faith Joe.  Her- strangers might but not her father, not her brother."
ang,"I want you to---act like he is coming back.  Don't think I haven't noticed you, both of you since Chris invited her here.  I won't stand for any nonsense."
ang,"Oh, laugh at me, laugh all you like but why does this happen to very night she comes back?  She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it, Joe look."
ang,"Believe with me Joe, you got to believe. Only last week a boy came back missing longer then Larry you read it yourself."
ang,You above all have got to believe. Just don't stop believing.
neu,"Well, maybe he wanted see her."
neu,"Well uh, He grew up next door to the girl, why wouldn't he want to see her?"
fru,Don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anything he told you.
fru,How do you know he's even thinking about it?
fru,Oh so what?
fru,"Okay, now listen, kids..."
fru,Listen. Line. You can't read her mind.
neu,And how do you know why she's waited.
fru,"Okay, look it's a beautiful day.  Why are we arguing?"
fru,What do you want me to do?  What do you want?
fru,Kate...
fru,[BREATHING]
fru,"All right, calm yourself."
fru,"Okay, calm yourself. Alright."
fru,calm yourself.
ang,What does that mean? Me above all? What does that mean?
ang,Look at you. You're shaking.
ang,"What the hell do you want from me, Kate?"
neu,The only one I know still love his parents.
neu,Oh it's not bad thing it's good thing.
sad,"Not sorry, no.  I can't stay here."
neu,For one thing your mother as much as told me to go.
sad,[BREATHING] And then you've been kind of...
sad,You've been kind of embarrassed ever since I got here.
neu,From her point of view why else would I come?
neu,I almost got married two years ago.
exc,Everyday since.
exc,"Because I was waiting for you, Chris.  Till then you never wrote me and then when you did, well, you sure can be ambiguous you know."
hap,I'll never forgive you for waiting so long.  All I did was sit around and wonder if I was crazy for thinking about you.
sad,"Chris, what's the matter?"
sad,"No, what is it?  Is your mother?"
sad,You got to tell me.
sad,Wouldn't work like this.
sad,"Yeah, sure."
sad,How many?
sad,[BREATHING]. Geez.
sad,Do you still feel that way?
hap,What would I do with a fortune?
hap,"Yeah, that kind of went out of style didn't it?"
hap,You're not sorry you came?
sad,Why not?
neu,What?
neu,You did?
neu,Yeah--
hap,"Ann, I love you.  I love you."
neu,Why didn't you?
exc,why didn't you let me know?
exc,I kissed you.  I kissed Annie.
hap,I kissed you.
sad,Do you want to go somewhere?  Let's go.
sad,"No, no, it's nothing like that."
sad,I don't know it's--it's complicated. But it's going from me now.
sad,I don't know.
sad,It's kind of all mixed up with all these other things.
sad,you know over seas I was in command of the company?
sad,Well I lost them.
sad,Pretty much all.
sad,"Takes awhile to toss something like that off.  I mean they weren't just men, you know."
sad,"For instance, there was this one time when this kid--it had been raining for like several days and he gave me his last pair of dry socks."
sad,He just put it in my pocket that's the kind of guys I had.
sad,"They didn't die they killed themselves for each other and I mean that exactly, you know a little more selfish and they'll all be here today..."
sad,"And I had this idea as I was watching them go down like everything was being destroyed, you know.  But I felt like this one new thing was being made, you know it's kind of like this.  This monument..."
sad,"You know, that they were bringing something on to this earth, a kind of sacrifice you know."
sad,"I thought I would change everything you know, and I got back here and it was- it was like nothing had changed at all..."
sad,You know.  I went to work with dad and I started that whole rat race again...
sad,And no one had changed it was just like sort of random bus accident to them.
sad,Driving my new car and I felt guilty you know opening my bank book seeing a new refrigerator.
sad,'Cause you can take those things out of a war.  But you have to realize that those things came out of the love that a man can have for another man...
sad,And if you can't see that then it's just loot and there's blood all over it.
sad,I felt ashamed and I didn't want any part of it.  I guess I included you too.
sad,I want you to know Annie.
hap,I'm going to make a fortune for you.
fru,Ugh...
ang,"You keep saying ""my flashlight"" like somehow it's just yours. How's that supposed to make me feel?"
neu,No.
neu,I'm fine.
hap,I wonder if they can hear me talk
fru,I'm cold.
fru,"It's after eleven, let's go home."
fru,There is no point.
fru,That's my point.
ang,Then let's go.
ang,"Pass what up?  These little fish swim out of the ocean, they flop around on the sand then they swim back and then they die."
fru,"I don't know what you're so excited about.  This isn't a moon landing we're talking about, it's fish, it's a fish nobody even eats."
fru,"Oh, Augie."
fru,I'm not.
ang,Yes.
ang,"Last year, you'll also remember we got--our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got into a big fight and we did not see the grunions."
ang,We didn't see them the year before either.
exc,"What time is it?  God, this is great, isn't it?  I can't believe it."
exc,"Of course I did want to a little further up the coast you know get away from all the lights and people and everything.  Is it midnight, do they always start at midnight?  Is that what it is midnight?  How you doing, huh? You okay?  That's good."
exc,"Look, there what's that, what's that?  Is it--"
exc,"Oh, no I can't tell though.  Although probably if you can't tell it probably isn't them right, yeah.  Probably going to be like unmistakable, right?"
exc,"Gosh, this is great, isn't it?  This is awesome.  Oh, no you know what I forgot?"
neu,Flashlight the silver one.  There's only one isn't there?
neu,"Oh, well, yeah of course."
neu,"Of course, our flashlight.  What's your is mine, mi flashlight es su flashlight."
neu,"Gosh, I should have brought it. I can't believe I forgot that."
exc,"You know what we should've brought a blanket too.  Man, our blanket, our blanket.  Wish I had six-pack too, a six-pack would be just the ticket right about now, huh, six-pack."
exc,"Oh yeah, I'm so excited right now I'm like a kid."
exc,I can't believe I got out of the house without my fly zipped up even.
fru,Do you want my jacket?
fru,What are you kidding?  We just got here.  We don't want to turn around and go home now.  What's the point coming all the way down here?
neu,Right.
neu,That's my point too.
fru,"No, wait no, no that's not my point.  My point is there is no point and coming all the way down here if we just turn around and go home."
fru,Why not?
fru,It's not stupid.  It's a natural phenomenon.
ang,People in Kansas would have to get plane tickets and make hotel reservations to see this.  It's only forty minutes away; it's just too good to pass up.
neu,"Yeah, they do."
exc,"Well, okay whatever, okay but it's a fish who do something that like no other fish do, you know, it's like those swallows that return to Capistrano or those like those lemmings that jumped off the cliffs, you know."
exc,"It's like a little bit of the unexplainable, a little magic, a little mystery.  I just don't see how you can not be interested in this."
fru,All right.
fru,"I don't get it though, I mean the first time we came here you said it was like the best night of your life..."
fru,And last year I remember like distinctively you were so excited to get here that you didn't realize you stubbed your toe until we were in a car.
neu,We just weren't in a good spot though.
neu,"Come on, trust me I got instincts for these things, okay?  So just--just think about it all right?  Okay, I know you're not interested, think about it..."
exc,"Out there, there's like this big mass of silver fish they're heading this way..."
exc,"They don't know why, we don't know why.  No one like sent them an invitation or gave them a map or direction..."
exc,They just all turned at once and they just form this line as long as the California coast.  And they just started swimming...
exc,Like some little time release fire cracker went off inside their little tiny bodies.  And they all turned as one...
exc,"And form the line and started swimming, swimming that would bring them to this point here..."
exc,It's like urgency that's pure urge you know.  It's single-mindedness with no mind.
exc,"It's crazy.  Look at this, I'm giving myself goose bumps, the hairs are standing up on my arm."
neu,That's the wind.
fru,I think it's ridiculous.
fru,It's a PR.
fru,They're all told the same thing.
fru,"Everybody is believes that it keeps them excited, you know it keeps them coming back for more."
fru,"Everybody keeps thinking that they can just find the right spot, you know they'll get it on the action."
fru,Their life will start then.
fru,I'm sorry it still just fish to me.
ang,"Why do you ask me that?  God damn it, I told you not to ask me that I hate it when you ask me that. It's insulting."
ang,"I just, we just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like."
fru,"Oh. Grow up Augie, the fish are not going to come."
ang,"Because they never do.  Do they, have they ever?"
ang,Twice is every year we've tried that's ever.
ang,No we won't.  It's pointless it's like a waiting up to see Santa Claus.
ang,"I feel like my whole life is going to be spent here on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly, waiting for fish to show up and the fish never show."
fru,You don't understand anything I'm saying.
neu,Do you remember the first year we came here? It's about four years ago right after we got married.
sad,"And I remember thinking this is it. finally, finally I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be."
sad,I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.
sad,No.
sad,No.
fru,No.
fru,No.
ang,I want something to turn out the way that it's supposed to.
ang,This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.
ang,"Oh, sure this is standing on the beach, this is waiting, fighting."
sad,This isn't anything like I thought anything would be.
sad,This is just this.  I mean it includes a lot and everything but it's--do you understand what I'm saying?
sad,"I know that Augie, I really do."
sad,"I just can't help wishing that I was somebody, somewhere else."
sad,I didn't say that.
sad,"You are the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else, someone who didn't take everything so seriously, someone who would enjoy yourself."
hap,I guess we don't need glasses.
hap,I'm beginning to think you might be right.  I think this might be the spot after all.
sad,"Augie, I'm sorry."
neu,Or not.
exc,...to this spot for this massive celebration of like sex and death...
exc,"Look at this, my hairs are standing up my arm. I'm giving myself goose bumps."
exc,"Well, so?  What do you think?"
fru,"It's not just me, okay?  Look at like all the people."
neu,Can I ask you a question?  Are you on your period?
fru,"Is not supposed to like anything.  We come down here, we look at the fish, they arrive, we go woo-ah fish."
fru,Why not?
neu,We missed them twice.
fru,"Okay we'll see them this year, this is a much better spot. Trust me."
fru,"Okay, I'm trying to work this backwards"
fru,and figure out where we took a turn to the worst thing.
fru,Of course not.
fru,"Okay.  I'm trying to work this backwards here and I'm trying to figure out the exact moment that you took a turn for the worst here, now."
neu,"you were fine during the phone call from Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was fine."
neu,"Let's see, uh, I took a shower and, um, you were watching the news and you said the ""the Grunions are running tonight,"" and I said ""okay great, let's go."""
neu,So I'm putting the animals out we're getting the car to the garage and--
neu,"Wait a minute, I've got it."
neu,"It was when we were driving passed that knickerbocker liquor locker and you would said, no you said ""let's get some champagne"" and I said ""no time to wasting"" or something like that.  That's what it is, right?"
neu,"Oh right sure, of course."
neu,You want me to go get some champagne?
neu,Do you want to take off our shoes?
neu,What? Huh?
neu,You want to get married again?
fru,What?  What?  You want to divorce?
fru,A vacation?
ang,"A new carpet, a poodle, a suicide pact, ice cream, a back rub, what?  What?  What the hell do you want?"
fru,"Well, welcome to the human race."
ang,You think nothing turns out how it's supposed to.  You think I had some grand idea going that four years down the line.  We would come to this beach and argue over fish?  No.
sad,"No, no I'm just like you, I thought it was going to be all rosy cheeks and the bills would pay themselves and fish will always come and--"
sad,No.  You know what you get?  You know what you get?  You get this.
neu,"Yeah, it is."
neu,Right.
sad,I know me neither.
sad,I'm doing the best I can.
sad,Maybe if you were with somebody else too?
sad,"No, I know but--I know I don't make you happy."
sad,Yeah?
hap,Look what we got here.
neu,It's not champagne.
neu,"Are you cold, huh?  Do you want to go home?"
hap,Shh...
hap,"If we are really quiet, the fish might come."
neu,Or not.
hap,Now and always sweet.
hap,It had to happen sooner or later.
exc,[BREATHING]
hap,Oh. Behave exquisitely...
hap,[LAUGHTER] I think I shall do a court curtsey.
hap,[LAUGHTER]
hap,Mmm...
hap,"Oh, yes meaning just that."
hap,[LAUGHTER] Don't laugh at me I'm being serious.
hap,"Mmhmm If I must laugh at everything, I must laugh at us too."
hap,"How long will it last, this ludicrous, overbearing love of ours?"
hap,Shall we always want to bicker and fight?
hap,If one of us dies...
hap,I think you're talking nonsense.
hap,Which particular one?
exc,"Oh, Charles.  That was his name Charles. He did wriggle so beautifully."
hap,Cannes...mmhmm...
hap,The manager came in he found us rolling about the floor.  [LAUGHTER]
hap,Scratching and biting like panthers. [LAUGHTER] Oh...
hap,"Utterly, utterly ridiculous."
hap,oh...[LAUGHTER]
hap,Very much sillier.
hap,I don't care then.
hap,With perfect poise...
hap,Ah...
hap,Ah...Strange...
hap,"Things that just ought to matter dreadfully, you know they just don't matter at all when one is happy, do they?"
sad,"Darling, don't say that."
hap,"Oh, dear god what is that all mean, dear god?"
hap,"You mustn't be so serious, darling, it just what they want."
hap,Flippancy brings out the acid in their darn sweetness and light.
hap,We are figures of fun all right
hap,Ahh...who knows.
exc,"Let's pity the poor philosophers, huh?  Let's enjoy the party for as long as we can, okay?  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and sit like small idiotic school children. [LAUGHTER]"
exc,"Come here darling, kiss me"
hap,before your body rots and worms pop out of your eye sockets.
hap,"See, you know I don't care what you do.  You could paint yourself green and run naked to the Place Vendome."
hap,Do you remember that row we did have in Venice?
exc,But you know it wasn't as bad as the one we had in Cannes...mmhmm...where your curling irons burnt a hole in my dressing gown.
hap,I will never forget the look on his face.
hap,oh...
hap,We were very much younger then.
neu,"Well, what of it?"
neu,"No, thank you."
ang,I don't see why you want any you already had two glasses.
ang,"Don't be stupid, what?"
ang,Well it's a woman's duty to allure the man. Watch me a minute will you?
ang,They sting.
ang,"I don't care.  I don't care, do you understand?  I don't mind if they bark and they roll about like hoops."
ang,"Yes, I did quite a lot."
ang,"Oh, mind you own business."
ang,"You're quite insufferable, I expect it's because you're drunk."
ang,You always had a weak head.
ang,"On the contrary, a child two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy."
ang,Shut up.
ang,Not very funny darling.  Why don't you have some more brandy?
ang,Why?
ang,They are away in Tunis.
ang,"Turn it on again, please."
ang,Very well if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.
ang,I won't.
ang,Stop it. No. Go away.
ang,"listen Oh I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you damn sadistic bully."
ang,"Oh you're cruel you're...you're...I hate you, I hate you. Go away. You're conceited. You're overbearing. You're utterly impossible."
ang,This is the end do you hear me?  Finally and forever.
ang,"Oh yes I am...Oh yes I am. Let go of me. You let go. You...urgh...You're a cruel friend. I loathe and I hate you. Marry you again...Ha...Never, never, never, never. I hope you die in torment. You beast."
neu,"I'll have a little, I think."
neu,"Oh, you know no particular reason besides they are very small glasses."
fru,"Really, Amanda."
fru,Nothing.
neu,Are you going out somewhere dear?
ang,"You know, it's a pity you didn't have any more brandy. It would have made you just a little less disagreeable."
ang,"You know what?  You snap, you snap, you snap you're like a little adder."
ang,Nonsense.  They have a bag of venom behind of fangs and they snap.
ang,Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?
ang,I suppose you let him just kiss you or good deal more than too.
ang,"I suppose you two had a riotous time, huh?  No restrain at all, very enjoyable, he never had much any how."
ang,I am not in the least bit drunk.
ang,I think I told you once before that I had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long.  A Child of two cannot get drunk on that.
ang,"Oh very, very interesting Amanda.  How about the child of uh... four, six or maybe nine---you know, we could work up a splendid little debate about it, you know?  Intemperate tots."
ang,That's a very good idea I think I will.
ang,Would you uh...turn that off please? You're going to wake the people upstairs.
ang,Well then you'll wake the people downstairs.
ang,This is no time a year for Tunis.
ang,I will do no such thing.
ang,Turn it off. It's driving me mad.
ang,Turn it off.
ang,Amanda listen. Listen.
ang,That's very amusing indeed.
ang,"You...You're an evil minded, self-centered little wench and I never want to see you again."
ang,You're not going like this.
ang,No you're not.
ang,Shut up. Shut up. I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling back to me on a bended knee. You are an evil tempered little vampire and I never want to see you again as long as I live.
neu,"Hi. Excuse me.  Um, I'd like to put in this application for my registration."
fru,No it doesn't say it on the form.
fru,"I mean it just says that you need some form of identification, but it doesn't say what kind of identification."
fru,I mean if I had known--I would have brought it.
fru,"Look, I've been waiting in line for a really long time.  I mean, you've seen how long it is."
fru,It's lunch hour.
fru,"Well, no.  I mean, I don't carry my original documents with me because if those things get destroyed, then what do you, you know what I mean, like if I loose my wallet or something, I'll never have them again."
fru,I have my passport and I have my driver's license. And that's all I have.
fru,"But, isn't there anything you can do.  Can't you make an exception this one time?  My picture is on both of those identifications.  It's not like you don't know that it's me."
fru,And I can give you my social--
fru,"Well, I can give you my Social Security Number."
fru,And I can tell you where I was born and what time and by who and what day.
fru,I can't go--I have to go back to work.  I don't have time to go back to my house and get all of that stuff and then get back in line and wait for another forty five minutes.
fru,"Um, I have kids.  I have to take them places on the weekends.  I don't have time to come back here.  Please.  I really need you to help me."
fru,Well.  [BREATHING] I just--I just don't.  I-I'm sorry that I'm standing here-- But I can't leave. I-
fru,"I really need this done today.  As you can see, the deadline is almost up and I can't come back."
ang,"Well, why didn't the D.M.V. put that you needed your birth certificate on the application then?"
ang,"Yeah, but your birth certificate--I mean, who carries around their birth certificate?  Nobody does that."
ang,With your driver's license and your passport.  Just like everybody else.
ang,"Who--you always use your driver's license.  I mean, you're not coming to the D.M.V. if you're not over sixteen and that's when you get your driver's license so you're never gonna need it anyway."
fru,Do you have a supervisor?
fru,"Well, thank you very much.  You've been very helpful."
neu,Hi.
neu,"Okay.  Let me see here.  Um, we need--we need your original birth certificate."
neu,Right.  Well.  We still need it.
neu,um Sorry.
fru,"Okay.  Um, I'm sorry but I--I can't help you.  You're gonna have to go back and uh..."
fru,Right.  It's the D.M.V..
fru,"I know, it gets long, but I can't do anything without your--do you have Social Security card, maybe?"
fru,"Alright, I don't know what to tell you right."
fru,"I think you're just gonna--you're gonna have to get 'em and then you can back and then, we'll help you out.  Maybe, we can-"
fru,I can't.
fru,"I make an exception for you and I have to make an exception for everyone.  I mean, I-I've seen this before and I know it's frustrating, but there's nothing I can do. You just have to-"
fru,"No, it's--"
fru,"Okay.  But how do I--that's- that's not proof to me.  How do I know that, you know, that it's really you.  I need--"
fru,"Well, the weekends are not as busy.  Maybe you can uh, come and try to get here early--"
fru,I can't.  There's nothing I can do.  I'm sorry.
ang,"Ok, but you're right now you're holding up more people in line by standing here-- and letting"
fru,"I--when you're going to the D.M.V., you usually need pretty professional identification--"
ang,"You know, Official documentation--"
fru,"No, but you come--you come to the D.M.V., it's something-- You should've- You should've figured--"
fru,"But, without your drive--where-where- what about your identification without your driver's license?  I mean, you need--you needed something before then?"
fru,"All right.  Well, um, you know, I'd love to help you, but--nothing I can do."
fru,"So, if you wanna go get your birth certificate, um, maybe come back--I don't--maybe you can talk to the person in the--in the front of line maybe.  I don't know."
fru,I am the supervisor.  So--
sad,It's almost time for me to go.
sad,"There's nothing I can do.  I mean, the government you know--"
sad,"You're gonna have to.  I mean, you're a great father.  You can do it.  I know you can."
sad,I don't think so.
sad,"Well, we can do the best we can and-and, with um, you know like wireless internet these days--I think that we could-- Talk every once in awhile."
sad,You could send me pictures.
sad,"Their not gonna let you.  You have to stay home and I have to go.  I mean, that's all--"
sad,"and--I mean, my daughter--I don't want to put her in danger.  You know?  She has to stay."
sad,"I know, but, she needs to be safe more.  She needs to be around kids her age--own age.  She needs to be able to play on the streets and--"
sad,You can just remember it for me.
sad,"Well, I need--I need you to be able to do this for me 'cause I can't do anything about it."
sad,"I mean, it's just as hard for me, but--I know that we can do it, you know"
sad,I don't want you in danger.  And I don't want her in danger.
sad,I have no choice. There's nothing I can do.
fru,What--what're we gonna do here?  I can't--I can't do this by myself.  I--
fru,"But, I'm--I'm nothing--I'm nothing without you here.  Maybe we can--we can get out of this somehow."
fru,"Well, come on.  You've gotta think of something.  A year--a year away, it's gonna tear us apart.  I don't even--I don't even wanna think about it.  I mean, I don't even know if I'll be able to get in touch with you or--"
fru,"What if--maybe--what if, uh, we went somewhere over there?  I don't--I don't know--I--I need to figure something out for this because--"
fru,This is gonna be a--a crucial yet--she's--she's growing up.  She's gonna need you.
sad,But she's--you're not gonna--you're not gonna be here for--for her first words.  For her first steps.  I mean--it's something that you're supposed to be here for that--
fru,I don't know--I don't know--I don't know how--I don't know how this could even be possible for you--I--if I was--
fru,"I mean, you just get to--go off and do your thing.  I mean, yeah, we're both--I don't know--it's bad for both of us, but--"
fru,...it would be so much better if we can--if we could stay together somehow.  You know--we could--we could do this together.
sad,All right.
exc,"Oh my God.  Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what?"
exc,"Well, guess.  Guess, guess, guess, guess."
exc,I'm so excited.
exc,"like all they have And I was like, what's going on?  And he like takes my hand and pulls me into the middle and he's like--you know, get's on his knee and everything--And says will you marry me? And I flipped out."
exc,'Cause- 'Cause he was with me. You didn't do it did you?
exc,You didn't know anything?
exc,"I was just--it was so like I thought this might happen eventually, but like not yet, you know what I mean?  Like--"
exc,"It is good.  It's totally good.  I mean, it like oh, you know."
hap,I know. So we're gonna take it--Like we're not gonna get married right away--'Cause we want to like have plenty of time to plan everything out
hap,"...and, um, my parents want to like be part of it and help out and everything--So we want to give it lots of time to like--"
hap,"Yeah, yeah, I called them. I called them And, of course, they were so excited 'cause they love him. Like they always have.  Um--"
hap,"So, yeah, I mean, it'll be good.  We wanna like, uh, I think we're gonna have it in spring time, like early Spring--So it's no too hot yet.  And um--"
hap,"I don't know.  I mean, I kinda like the idea of having something outside, but--Like--is a- Yeah,"
exc,"Yeah, I don't know-[LAUGHTER]-I mean--I can't even--the whole idea of like living--spending my whole life with somebody--that's crazy"
hap,Thank you. Thank you so much.
exc,"Oh, you will--You'll find just the right girl.  And she'll be perfect for you and everything will be great."
hap,"Yeah, it's pretty good."
hap,"Of course, of course--you'll be able to be a part of it.  You can come help me pick my colors."
exc,"It's so girly.  I don't even know how to like--It's so weird, but it'll be fun.  My mom will love to be like--she'll get so into it, I'm sure."
hap,She'll be like--flowers and the--
hap,"Oh, thank you. [LAUGHTER]"
neu,"Um, you--"
hap,That is great.  You look radiant.  I should've guess.
exc,"Well, Tell me about him.  What happened."
hap,"Yeah.  I mean candles wouldn't stay--No, I didn't--I didn't know anything about it."
hap,No. I'm just as happy as you are.  This is--
hap,"So, I mean--it's good though."
exc,"Yeah, I know.  Wow.  I'm shaking.  I can't even--"
neu,"Oh. Do they--do they know yet? Have you told them? Oh, that's--"
neu,That's great.  Yeah.
neu,Okay. You know--you know where?  Or--
neu,"Uh, huh. I mean, you know, it's spring--It'll be--"
neu,Spring's nice though.
neu,"Yeah, that is--how long you guys been together now?"
hap,Okay.  All right.  So-[LAUGHTER]-quite a while.  I mean--That's-  That's good.  I'm so happy for you. [LAUGHTER]
hap,"Yeah, I'd love to be in that same situation some day, but, wow- so-"
hap,"Oh, I approve. I-[LAUGHTER]-I more than approve."
hap,"I mean, I'm surprised he didn't, ya know--go get a plane to fly over and shine--But candles on the beach, that's okay too I guess--"
exc,"Well--can--I mean, let me know--I want- I want invitations and--"
exc,"Oh, yes.  This is the whole [GARBAGE]"
hap,"It'll be good.  Wow, that's great."
fru,I'm--every lead that I get ends up just being a dead end.  You know what I mean.  People are sick of me calling--
fru,"Yeah, but it--I mean it's the same response you get over and over again.  Like--"
fru,"Oh, we're not hiring at this time or thank you, we already have your information on file--We'll call you when we're ready."
fru,"But, it's been so long, like--I mine as well just take a job at McDonald's.  Like, I don't--"
fru,"I just--I can't do it anymore.  Like, it just takes it out of you--"
fru,I just keep getting rejected.  I just keep getting rejected over and over and over again and it starts to make you feel like there must be something wrong with you that you can't get a job.
fru,"Yeah, but maybe--if just because it's competitive, like maybe I'm just not good enough.  Maybe the level is here and I'm here and there's just no way I'm ever gonna do that--"
fru,"I didn't have like one of those starts, you know, like a family member who was already in the business or something you know that could like give me a helping hand."
fru,"It's just so frustrating.  Like, I just--I just don't wanna do it anymore.  You know?  I just don't wanna like hit the pavement every single day with my resumes and going out there all the time.  You know, it's just like--"
sad,I feel so worthless.
fru,And what would make you say that?  There doesn't seem to be any indicators that anything's going to get better.
fru,"It's just really hard.  I feel like their starting to get like a personal prejudice against me.  You know what I mean?  Like it's like suddenly it starts to feel like it's just you that they say no to and it's not that they're not taking applications and it's not that they're not hiring people, it's just you particularly they have some particular reason for just hating you.  You know?"
fru,Or they'll never talk to me again.
fru,"I-I just I think maybe I should try something else.  I mean, I-I don't know.  All growing up this is the only thing that I ever wanted to do and yet I can't.  I'm not physically able apparently.  I mean--"
fru,"I guess the money shouldn't matter to me, but--Somehow it does.  You know? It's not like I do it for the money, but"
fru,"you have to--I mean, if you're hired by somebody, then you're not a professional, you're an amateur and that means that you're not good enough."
sad,"I just wanna crawl in a hole, you know.  Like it just makes you not wanna even open your eyes in the morning."
neu,"So, uh, so how's it been going?  I mean, you have any needs or anything?"
neu,"No.  You can't think that way.  I mean it's good--it's good that you're--that you're calling, you know. you can't"
neu,"No, come on.  Don't [GARBAGE]"
neu,"I know.  I know. It's hard, but you just--you gotta keep going.  I mean, you've been going at it for so long, you know.  Something is definitely going to come up.  I-I know it will, because you're a good worker--"
neu,"No.  It's--I mean, it's competitive, you know.  That's-That's what it is.  that's what you gotta be is competitive."
neu,"There...There are plenty of people out there with--with like, good jobs, you know, that are a lot..."
neu,...dumber than you.  I mean they're a lot worse off than you.  You are much better off than like a lot of those people in there. I know
neu,"I know.  It makes it harder.  I mean it's definitely who you know in a lot of cases, but--"
neu,"But you gotta.  Otherwise, what is--what's your other option?"
neu,"It's not worthless 'cause it's definitely gonna--it's definitely gonna pay off.  I know it.  I mean, I can--I've just--I've seen your work etiquette.  You know, you're a good worker and..."
neu,... and there's no reason that--that something won't come up like really soon.  All right?  So you just gotta--
neu,"Because I know you.  You know, and maybe once you get to know some more people, like talking to them and everything, they'll get to know you too and they'll realize they should've hired you three years ago.  You know? but  And- and they'll finally come around and believe me--it'll--you gotta-"
neu,"Well maybe yeah, but maybe you get to that point where it's like you bug 'em and then they just don't wanna hear from you anymore, but you keep bugging them and bugging them and then it's gonna annoy them so much that they're gonna be like all right fine. you know"
fru,"Or, well, no.  Okay. you -[GARBAGE]"
neu,"That obviously that's not true though.  I mean, you've done this before.  You've done all the work like this before, you know, and and you've gotten people saying oh, you're so good and like you know--"
neu,Right.
neu,"Well, you've gotta live."
neu,"I mean, it's just, it's really--I don't know, yeah, it's about their opinions and it's about, I don't know, just getting yourself out there and--"
neu,"Well, come on, come on.  Thinking about it like this is definitely not gonna help either though."
neu,"Hi, um, excuse me, I believe that the airline lost my baggage."
neu,"No, it didn't. um It didn't come out and I don't see it anywhere around here, so what can you do about that?"
neu,How much?
ang,"That's all, that's all, that's all you're going to do is just give me fifty dollars and say go have fun on your vacation without any of your stuff?"
fru,"Yes, yes, I would like to file a claim, but what are you gonna--I mean, is it just gonna show up magically out of nowhere?"
ang,"Because you don't seem to care very much, you know."
fru,I didn't sign anything.
fru,"[BREATHING] Well, sure, yeah, I guess I'll go buy dinner and then be--have nothing for the rest of my entire vacation.  I'm supposed to be here for three weeks.  What am I gonna do without anything for three weeks?"
fru,But fifty dollars isn't going to get me anything.
fru,Isn't there anything else you can do?
fru,"I mean, is there somebody you can call?  Or the guy that put the stuff on the--on the plane.  I mean, are they--they must be really irresponsible to have just disappeared my baggage.  I mean, did it get stolen?"
fru,"Yeah, I'm sure you -- You're like, hmm, do you take baggage?  No.  Oh, okay, thanks.  Great.  I mean how--"
fru,There needs to be better security here.
ang,It sounds like it's such a little like oh well no big deal whatever.  It's a big deal to me.
fru,"Well, can I at least have my fifty dollars, please?"
fru,Thank you very much.
neu,"Um, okay, it didn't--didn't come out on the carrousel--"
neu,"Okay.  Um, well, unfortunately yeah there was a some- some problems with the--"
neu,"Uh, well some-some of the bags were--were lost on the way over here. uh-"
neu,"You know, I mean, there's a lot of things that go on under the plane and sometimes, you know, that kind of things happen."
neu,"Uh, But, we are willing to reimburse you for the bag and and for the contents--"
neu,"Um, we'd be willing to give you uh fifty dollars for--"
neu,"Right.  Uh We realize, you know, that that it's a bad situation, but I'm sorry, there's nothing that we can really do."
neu,"I think, um, maybe you can file a claim if you want and turn it in to our main office--"
neu,"Right.  No.  I mean they- they might--they might--if you-if you are argue the case more, maybe they'll reimburse you more, but, right now--"
neu,"Yes, I know. I know-. It's It's frustrating.  Unfortunately though-- um"
neu,"By checking your bags, you--you, you know- admit to the liability that's- that's at risk--"
neu,"Right, well, by checking in your bags, you agreed to, you know, at the will of the--"
neu,"You paid for the flight and then your bags were checked at--it's a service that the airline provides for us.  So so, really, it's really the risk was taken and, I'm sorry, but there's really nothing else we can do.  So do you want--do you want the reimbursement?"
neu,"Well, there are-there are some shops here in- in the airport--"
neu,"No, um, like I said you can file a claim and, uh, maybe get reimbursed for more-- you"
neu,probably even talk to--
neu,"Right, that--that gets taken care of-- That gets taken care of.  We get we do, you know, we investigate those and just make sure that um- they're not doing their own thing with them so--uh"
neu,but Unfortunately sometimes is--
neu,"Well, that's--that's what I'm saying--"
neu,"Okay.  Well that that could be something that you put on on the claim--on on the complaint form if you want.  And provide us with your information while you're here and then, maybe, if it turns up, then we'll send it right over."
neu,"All right, Miss, I-I know.  I realize this. But Like I said, there are several people that are in your same situation, so, um, it's not--it's not totally uncommon and I'm actually gonna have to ask you to move so I can help the next person."
neu,"Yes, all right.  There you go, now you can file a claim over to the left--And they'll help you out."
sad,"Um, Johnny died yesterday."
sad,"We knew that it was coming, but--"
sad,"It seemed like he had a little bit longer.  Like just last week, he was doing was so well."
sad,Yeah.
sad,I just don't want him to be gone.
sad,And his whole family was there.
sad,"I mean, he was like really conscious right up until the end. you know"
sad,"He was so young, you know.  And all the stories he used to tell me about..."
sad,...the way he wanted to live and he was gonna go to Africa and he was gonna--
sad,Nobody's ever gonna forget him.
sad,He did a lot.  But--
sad,I'm gonna forget him.
sad,I won't be able to hear his voice or his--
sad,You start to lose like that image after a while.
sad,Thanks.
neu,"Hey, a what's up?"
neu,"Wow, that's horrible."
neu,I'm sorry to hear about that.
neu,Yeah.
neu,"I mean, you know, at least he's not in anymore pain now, right?"
neu,"It's good, you know.  you know It hurts I know.  I know what it's like to lose someone like that."
neu,It's okay.
neu,"'Cause, you know, you've got all the times that you guys did spend together, you know and that's something good that you can look back on."
neu,I mean--I don't know.
neu,"Well, that's that's good, you know.  At least, I don't know.  I mean it's- it's better to go- to goout that way than..."
neu,".than you know, in pain and like this gradual, this horrible process.  I mean--"
neu,"But look at the--he--look at the life he did get to lead.  I mean, for his age, he'd done so much and--"
neu,"Yeah, exactly.  He's made a big impact on a lot of people. and"
neu,"And you'll always have that and--you should feel, you know, happy for him that he got to do so much before--I mean, and even after he found out last year.  I mean--"
neu,"I know.  It doesn't bring him back, but--"
neu,"But It's okay because now, you know, you'll just go on with your life and--"
neu,"No, you'll never forget him."
neu,I know. but you're not  I mean you're not going to forget him.  The pain will go away eventually and--or it will subside--
neu,"That will be, It'll be--it'll be better that way. I mean Time will tell.  Time heals, you know, and it's good.  It's okay.  I mean, it wasn't anybody's fault or anything like that so ."
neu,"It's hard to lose someone that way, but he's he's better--he's better off now."
exc,I got into U.S.C.
exc,"Yeah, I'm so excited.  So I'm gonna say--"
exc,"Yeah, I think, I mean because where else would I gonna go?  Like the other places that I applied to I really didn't like that much anyway."
exc,So--
exc,"Yeah, I know."
exc,Absolutely. I'm so excited.
exc,"I know.  I know. And we'll all get to hang out.  And I'm--even though we'll be at like at different parts of the city, we can still, like..."
exc,"...hang out and, like, have our different lives--And meet each other's friends and stuff.  So, I'm just so glad 'cause they have such a good school"
exc,"and like-- The football team--And like all the-...you- what I mean, like..."
exc,"You can walk somewhere and be anywhere in the country and be like, oh, yeah, I am at U.S.C."
exc,"And you know what, you know what I mean, like it's recognizable rather than just being like I went some random school. It's like people really know what you..."
exc,"...like, they feel like--I feel like it's going to be so like accomplished.  Do you know what I mean?"
exc,Like it has some prestige. so
exc,"Yeah, I mean there's all the money stuff and my mom's helping me with the financial aid and stuff.  But, it'll be fine--"
exc,"Like, now that I'm accepted, it's just, like, such a huge load off my mind."
exc,I don't mind worrying about all the paperwork.  You know--
exc,"Because, I don't have to like make that decision anymore.  I don't have to try and decide, like, what the bad school I'm going to go to is. you know"
exc,"I know. I know.  I think you go and you like stay for a couple of days and you meet people and--And they'll give you like a tour--And show you everything.  Oh, man, I'm just so--I'm so excited."
exc,"Yeah, oh totally.  It's a beautiful campus.  It's gonna be really nice.  Um, and everyone is friendly and like there's ivy on all the walls.  Oh, it's just so--it's so like collegiate."
exc,"You know what I mean?  Like, it's like exactly what I want."
exc,"Well, you know, I've thought about it but they have so many things that I might--Like try some things out first..."
exc,"...because also on the list of their, um, like G.E.'s or whatever, you have a lot of choices within every single one.  So you can, like, try things out and not just be like, oh, I have to take math, oh, I have to take this.  You know what I mean?"
exc,"So, um, so I don't know."
exc,I mean I'm gonna take a bunch of stuff and see.
exc,"I- They have like--they just have so many like prestigious like this school is top ten and like the departments within it, you know what I mean."
exc,"I know, I get to be one of those now--I'll like walk around and be like a U.S.C..  You know what I mean."
exc,And you'll be like...
exc,"Student. I'm a student. Yes I am, Thank you very much."
exc,[BREATHING]
exc,I know.  I'm excited.
exc,"Well, that'll take a while. [GARBAGE]"
exc,That's going to be a lot of work.
exc,"But, it'll be fine, I mean.  I'm so excited. It's going to be so fun."
exc,"I know, and I mean the area's not great, but like the school makes up for it. It'll be fine. It'll be good."
exc,I know. I know. So fun.  I can't wait.
exc,I will. I will. Thank you.
exc,Thanks.
neu,"So, how's it going?"
exc,"Oh, you got what?  Where?"
exc,"Oh, no way."
exc,Are you gonna go? you gonna-
exc,"Wow, that's..."
exc,"...that's first choice, huh? That's so awesome and now look you're gonna be--you're gonna be here. you know"
exc,"Yeah, no, definitely--It's gonna.."
exc,Yeah.
exc,Yeah
exc,Fight on.
exc,[LAUGHTER]
exc,Wow. That's cool.
neu,So...
exc,"Right.  Right.  Right. Oh, man, then you're going to have to do orientation, I guess."
hap,That'll be awesome.
hap,"I mean because you went to the campus before, right?"
exc,Oh man.
exc,Ahh. Yeah. [GARBAGE]
exc,"You'll be like are you a fan or a student you know? Student. [LAUGHTER] Oh man, that's awesome."
exc,A U.S.C. graduate now. You're set.
exc,You're getting close to the beach.  I mean geez.
neu,"Hi, my name is Shiloh, welcome to--Airline Six.  Hi, how may I help you?"
neu,"All right, sir."
neu,I completely understand.  Automated systems are very difficult sometimes.
neu,"Um, how may I help you.  You're trying to book a specific flight?"
neu,"Oh, yeah, absolutely.  You know, and especially because you've been waiting so long and I know that, um, you've been having a difficult time."
neu,"I want to definitely give you our special package today, which um is usually only for valued customers who have a record of having previous,"
neu,"um lots of purchases, but we're gonna go ahead and give that to you anyway. uh,  Just to make sure that you're happy with your service here."
neu,Is that all right?
neu,"I can do that right now for you. No, absolutely.  I can take care of you all the way through to the end."
neu,All I'm going to need is your credit card number but just give me one moment. So-
neu,"um, you're scheduling a flight as well--And you would like to, um, we have a highly discounted hotel rate that goes along with that so that everything is all in one deal.  You're taken care of by the time that you get there."
neu,Absolutely. we we
neu,"Yes, I completely understand.  Actually, our-our airline only uses five star hotel and above.  Except we charge at a three star hotel rate because, as a corporation, we are able to get a deal from the hotels themselves."
neu,"So, you will absolutely be in a high rated great hotel and we can make sure that it's in a area of town that you like as well."
neu,Yeah.
neu,Okay.
neu,Great.  How many seats?
neu,Okay.  Great.  Four seats.  I'll book you for four seats.
neu,"Oh, yeah, absolutely.  Um- Would you like window seats or aisles?"
neu,"Okay, I can do um- a win- -two like a window and a aisle and a window and an aisle next to each other so that each of you can sit two by two. And switch around maybe?"
neu,Okay.  Great.  What time of the day would you like?
neu,All right.  Great.  Well we have a very open flight that leaves at nine a.m. and fortunately uh the time change actually goes um backwards from that.
neu,"So, it's a five hour flight, but you'll arrive only at eleven a clock in the morning.  So that day, you can have plenty of time to get to your hotel--Rest up and then still have a nice afternoon your first afternoon in Maui."
neu,Absolutely.  That actually goes in on the same package with our hotel.  You just give me your address.  We'll come and pick up a time that allows you to get to your flight with plenty of time to spare.
neu,And a there will also be a shuttle waiting for you to take you to the appropriate hotel.
neu,Yeah--I completely understand.  It's a difficult process sometimes and we want to make traveling as easy as possible.
neu,Absolutely. Thank you so much for calling and we hope that you will come to us again.
neu,Thank you.
fru,"Yeah, hello."
fru,Ok.  I've- I've just been talking to this machine for the past half hour and I can't-can't get anything done.  I've been trying to book this vacation this entire time.
fru,"I know, I'm sorry.  It's-It's just that it's been a little frustrating because--"
neu,Okay.
fru,"Well, yeah, I mean I heard there was like these package deals and that maybe I could get a like a hotel or something like that. and-"
neu,You- You can do that--You can do that now? I don't have to get like transferred through or anything like that.
neu,[BREATHING] that's good.
neu,"All right.  I want to make sure it's like a nice hotel--I mean-mean I'm gonna be paying a lot of money for this so I don't wanna-I don't wanna, you know, I don't wanna to be a waste of time."
neu,Okay. So--
neu,"Well, you know, we wanted to--we wanted to go to Maui and--That was a"
neu,#NAME?
neu,"Well, it's gonna be four of them."
neu,All right.  And can they like all get together?
neu,"Um- You know, window is nice. I guess"
neu,"Uh, well, yeah, I think we were just--you know, whenever best available, I guess.  You know--"
neu,"And, like, there's there's shuttles or something that I can get to the hotel."
neu,All right.  So we're confirmed then or do you--All right.
neu,Okay.
sad,Did you talk to him?
sad,He cried hard?
sad,What was he doing out here at that hour?
fru,What do you want to do argue with him?
fru,You can't say that to him.
fru,Can you prove it?  How can you prove it?
fru,"To you it is and to me, but not to him.  I mean, you can talk yourself blue in the face, but he--there's no body and no grave so where are you?"
sad,"I've got an idea, but what's the story?"
neu,"Well, that's only your business, Chris."
ang,What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.
neu,I'm just saying that--
fru,"From your father's point of view, he isn't dead.  And you've no right to take his girl."
fru,"And you can go on from there if you know where to go, but I don't know where to go.  See, I don't know.  Now what can I do for you?"
neu,You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong with that.
neu,[BREATHING] Have you asked Annie yet?
neu,"Well, how do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way your father does."
sad,"Trouble is, you don't see enough women."
fru,You never did.
fru,I just don't see why it has to be Annie.
fru,"Well, that's a good answer, but it doesn't answer anything.  I mean, you've been away for--at war.  It's been five years."
fru,"I don't want a diagram.  Umm-- He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl and you're pronouncing him dead."
fru,"I mean, what's gonna happen to your father?  Do you know?  I don't."
fru,I just--give it some more thought.
ang,Are you crazy?
ang,What about the business?  What the hell is this?
ang,Must you be inspired?
ang,"Well, you don't want to think like that."
fru,"All right.  Just-- just don't go thinkin' that way, you hear me?"
fru,"I don't understand you, do I?"
sad,I can see that.
ang,Why shouldn't he dream of him and walk the nights waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had hope for years now?
fru,We've got to say it to him.
ang,"For God sakes, it's been three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane."
fru,All right.  All right.  Listen to me.  You know why I brought Annie here don't you?
neu,I'm gonna ask her to marry me.
fru,You know it's not only my business.
fru,So it's all right then?
fru,I'll go ahead with it?
ang,"Well, then it isn't just my business--"
ang,She's not Larry's girl.
fru,"I don't know why, but, every time I reach out for something that I want, I have to pull back 'cause someone else will suffer.  My whole bloody life.  Time after time after time."
ang,To hell with that.
sad,"Well, if she does, then that's the end of it.  But from her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.  And then we'll thrash it out with Dad, right?  Mom, don't avoid me."
neu,Because it is.
fru,"These years when I think of a wife, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?"
fru,"All right.  All right, then, Mom."
fru,I've given it three years of thought.  I thought that if I waited Dad would forget about Larry and we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.
ang,I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker.  I'm through with it.
ang,The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.
ang,"Yes.  I like it an hour a day.  If I'm gonna grub for my money all day long, at least in the evening I want it beautiful."
neu,"Yes, on this I would."
fru,"I know.  I know, Mom.  Just help me stay here."
neu,I am thinkin' that way.
neu,"No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy."
ang,It's got that all about it.
fru,"Well then why is she still single?  I mean, New York is full of men.  Why isn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's crazy, but she's waited."
fru,"She knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right."
fru,I want you to act like he's coming back.  Both of you.  Don't you think I haven't noticed since she got here.  I won't stand for any nonsense.
ang,"Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.  I mean, laugh--laugh at me, but..."
ang,But why did that happen the very night she came here?  She sleeps in his room and his memorial breaks to pieces.  Just look.  Look at it.
fru,"Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand all alone."
fru,"Last week, a man turned up in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  I mean, you read it yourself."
fru,"You, above all, have to believe."
fru,Just--just don't stop believing.
fru,I can't help it.
neu,"Well, maybe he just wanted to see her again."
neu,What do you mean?  He lived next door to the girl all his life.  Why wouldn't he want to see her again?
neu,How do you know he's even thinking of it?
neu,"Well, so what?"
neu,"Now, listen Kate."
neu,You can't read her mind.
neu,How do you know why she's waited?
fru,"Look, it's a nice day.  What are we arguing for?"
fru,"Well, what do you want me to do about it?"
fru,But Kate--
fru,Calm yourself.
fru,Calm yourself.
fru,All right.  All right.  Calm yourself.
ang,What does that mean?  Me above all?
ang,Look at you.  Look at you shaking.
ang,What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you Kate?
sad,"from her point of view, why else would I come?"
hap,I almost got married two years ago.
hap,You started to write me and--
hap,Every day since.
hap,I will never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I did was sit and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.
sad,"Then, what's wrong?  I mean, even in your letters there was some--something ashamed."
sad,You've gotta tell me.
sad,It wouldn't work this way.
sad,"Yeah, sure."
sad,How many?
sad,"Oh, gee."
sad,You still feel that way?
hap,What'll I do with a fortune?
neu,You're not sorry you came?
exc,"You feel it's wrong here, don't you?  This yard, this chair.  I want you to be ready for me.  I don't want to have to win you away from anything."
sad,No.  Nothing like that.
sad,"Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me."
sad,I don't know how to start.
sad,"It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in command of a company?"
sad,"Well, I lost them."
sad,Just about all.
sad,It takes some time for a guy to toss that off.  'Cause they weren't just men.
sad,"For instance, one time, it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.  I put them in pocket.  It's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had."
sad,"They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today."
sad,"I got this idea watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed, see, but it seemed that there was one new thing being made.  A sort of responsibility.  Man for man."
sad,"You know what I mean?  To show that, to bring that onto the Earth again, like some kind of monument and everyone would feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him."
sad,Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them seemed like sort of a bus accident.  I went to work with Dad and that rat race again.
sad,"And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody was changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator."
sad,"I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've gotta be a little better because of it."
sad,Because otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of it.  And I guess that included you.
neu,What flashlight?
neu,Yeah.
fru,"It's after eleven, let's just go home."
fru,"Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, they flop around, and swim away.  And then they die."
fru,"What are you so excited about?  I mean, it's not a moon landing we're talking about here.  It's fish.  It's a fish nobody even eats."
fru,"Ah, Augie."
fru,I'm just not.
fru,"Last year, you will also remember our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got in a big fight over nothing, and we didn't see the grunions."
neu,We didn't see them the first time either.
neu,About what?
exc,What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.
exc,"This is great, isn't it?  Look at the night we've got here, couldn't be better."
exc,"I would have liked to have gone a little further up the coast to get away from the lights and the people, but I was afraid we'd miss it."
exc,How you doing?
exc,Is that--no--is that just foam?  I can't even tell.
exc,"Well, I guess we can tell, it probably isn't right?  Probably be unmistakable don't you think?"
exc,"How you doing?  Aw, you know what I forgot?  I forgot to bring my flashlight.  Oh, how could I be so stupid?  I should've brought my flashlight."
neu,"Oh, well sure."
neu,"Right, of course.  Our flashlight.  Mine and yours.  I mean, me flashlight is su flashlight naturally."
neu,"I wonder, do they always run during a full moon?  I can't remember if it was full last year.  Do you remember?"
neu,"You cold?  Do you want my jacket?  Oh, we should've brought the blanket.  Our blanket."
exc,"This is great, isn't it?  A six pack would be just the ticket right now."
exc,I can't believe I forgot.  I'm like a kid.  It's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped.
exc,You think they can hear us talk?  Or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?
neu,Do you want my jacket?
neu,Right.
neu,That's my point too.
neu,No. No. That's not my point.  The point is there's no point in coming down if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it?
exc,"Think about the people in Kansas, they had to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to see this.  We live forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up."
exc,"Yeah, but that moment on the beach, is the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping is laying eggs or what do you--spawning or mating.  I mean,"
exc,this is a big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy.
fru,Yeah they do.
exc,Alright.  But it's fish that do something that none of the other fish do.  Like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs.
neu,"I don't get it.  The first time we came here, you said it was the best night of your life."
neu,We weren't in a good spot.
exc,There is that--no that's just seaweed isn't it?
exc,"Oh man, this is great, isn't it?  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  Here, think about this, all right, I know you're not interested, but think about this."
exc,"all as one, this time release instinctual little firecracker went off and they all turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.  And they're swimming right now as if that's all that matters."
exc,It's like single mindedness with no mind.  It's urgency that's pure urge.  They don't know what drives them.  They don't ask it a question or give it a name.
exc,"They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them right here to where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death."
exc,"Ah, God, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  Look, all my hairs are popped up."
neu,"Well, so what do you think?"
neu,What I was saying.
neu,About what?
fru,It's ridiculous.
ang,"God damn it, Augie, don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  You always ask me that.  It's insulting."
ang,We just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.
fru,"For heaven sake, we're not going to see the grunions."
fru,"We never do, do we?  I mean, have we ever?"
fru,Twice is every time we've tried. That's ever.
fru,"No, we won't.  It's pointless.  It's like waiting up to see Santa Claus."
ang,"I mean, I feel like my whole life is gonna be spent standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for the fish to show up.  And the fish won't show up."
fru,You don't understand anything I'm saying.
fru,I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking that this is gonna be the time and it never is.
sad,"Do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago, right after we got married."
sad,"I thought I was pregnant, you had a bottle of champagne, but no glasses.  You asked me to dance, so we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork."
sad,"And while we were dancing, you said the softest, most intimate things to me right into my ear so that I could feel them as much as hear them."
sad,"And I remember thinking, this is it.  You know, at last--at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be."
sad,"Just dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle."
sad,I'd rather not remember some things.  I would rather not hope for some things.
sad,No.
sad,No.
sad,No.
fru,No.
fru,No.
fru,No.
sad,Well.  This isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.
sad,"I know that, Augie.  Really, I do."
sad,"I know that you meant this to be special and nice and the sand and the moon and all, but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else."
sad,I didn't say that.
sad,You're the one who probably wishes you were with someone else.  Someone who--you'd rather enjoy yourself and didn't take everything so hard.
hap,"Augie, you brought refreshments."
hap,"Well, then we don't need glasses."
hap,No.  I think you might be right.  Maybe this is the spot after all.
sad,"Augie, I'm sorry."
hap,Or not.
exc,"Well, so what do you think?"
neu,What I was saying.
neu,It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.
neu,"Well, I'm not the only one.  Look at all these people."
neu,"Carla, can I ask you something?  Don't take this wrong, but are you having your period?"
fru,"Well, what's bugging you?"
neu,"There's nothing to it.  We come here, the grunion arrive, they do their little fish business, we go ooh, ah, look at the fish.  They go home. We go home."
fru,Why not?
neu,We've missed them twice.  That's not ever.
neu,"Well, we'll see them this year."
fru,I thought you wanted to see it.
fru,"No, of course not."
neu,It's just fish.  Nothing to get traumatized about.
fru,"All right.  Look, I've been trying to work this backwards, but I cannot seem to figure out the exact moment that we took a turn for the worst."
neu,"You said, ""Hey the grunion are running tonight.""  I said, ""Great, let's go.  I feel lucky."""
neu,"Okay, so I'm putting on my jacket, putting out the animals, getting the car out of the garage--"
neu,Wait a minute.  I've got it.
neu,"It was in the car, right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, ""let's get some champagne,"" and I said, ""time's a wasting"" or something like that, right?"
neu,"Yeah, of course, I see it now.  You want this to be like that other time, right?  That's it, right?"
neu,"Okay, yeah, sure, I see it now.  Listen, you wanna dance?"
neu,You want me to go get some champagne?
neu,Take off our shoes?
fru,"Well, what?  You want me to breathe in your ear?"
fru,You wanna get married again?
fru,What?  What?  You want a divorce?
fru,A vacation?
fru,"A new carpet?  A poodle?  Ice cream?  Back rub?  A suicide pact?  What?  What?  Carla, what the hell do you want?"
ang,"Well, welcome to the human race.  Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed?  That four years down the road, we'd be at the beach yelling at each other over fish?"
sad,"No, Carla, I'm just like you.  I thought it was gonna be all peaches and roses and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us"
fru,"'cause you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This."
neu,"Yes, it is."
neu,Right.
sad,"I know, me neither."
sad,I'm doing the best I can.
sad,Maybe if you were with somebody else too.
sad,"No, I know.  But still.  I know I don't make you happy."
hap,"I don't know.  It seemed like a pretty good spot to me.  I mean, look at the view you have of the moon from here."
hap,"Well, look what we have here."
hap,It's not champagne.
hap,Shh.  If we're very quiet the fish might come.
hap,Or not.
exc,"Ah, it send shivers up my spine."
hap,Behave exquisitely.
hap,"Oh, of course.  I shall probably do a court curtsy."
hap,What's so horrible is that one can't stay happy.
hap,It's true.  The whole business is a very poor joke.
hap,"Yes, meaning just that."
neu,Who's they?
neu,"If I laugh at everything, then I must laugh at us too."
neu,"Well how long will it last us, this ludicrous overbearing love of ours."
neu,"Well, shall we always want to bicker and fight?"
neu,"Oh, dear, shall we like that?"
neu,"Well, what happens if one of us dies?  I mean, does the one that's left still laugh?"
hap,"Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense."
hap,"Elliott, worms don't pop."
hap,"Oh, thank you, dear.  The same applies to you except that if I catch so much as looking at another woman, I'll kill you."
hap,Which particular one?
hap,Charles.  That was his name.  Charles.  He did wriggle so beautifully.
hap,"Yes, I know you did.  You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that."
hap,It went in intermittently for days.
hap,It burned my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.
neu,That was the first time you ever hit me.
hap,"The manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers."
exc,It was ridiculous.  Completely ridiculous.
neu,I wonder.
neu,I don't care then.
neu,Hello?  Hello?  What?  Wrong number.
neu,With the most perfect poise?
neu,Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy.  Do they?
neu,"Oh, darling, don't say that."
neu,"Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love?"
neu,"You mustn't be serious, my dear one.  That's just what they want."
neu,All those futile moralists that try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything.  All their sacred shibboleths.
neu,Flippancy brings out the acid in their damn sweetness and light.
neu,"Certainly, you must.  We're figures of fun, alright."
neu,Who knows.
neu,"No, that desire will fade.  Along with our passion."
neu,Depends on how well we've played.
exc,Yes.  Yes. With all his might.
exc,"No. No, it isn't.  Death is very laughable.  Such a cunning little mystery.  All done with mirrors."
neu,So is everyone else in the long run.
exc,"Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow our trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can.  Like quite idiotic, very small school children.  Let's savor the delight of the moment."
exc,"Come and kiss me, darling, before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets."
neu,"I don't care what you do.  See, you could paint yourself green and dance naked in the Place Vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word.  As long as you love me best."
neu,You remember that awful scene we had in Venice?
neu,The one when you bought that little painted wooden snake in the Piazza and put it on my bed.
neu,How long did that row last?
neu,The worst one was in Cannes when your curling iron burnt a hole in my new dressing gown.
neu,I didn't hit you very hard.
exc,"Oh, I'll never forget his face."
neu,We were very much younger then.
neu,"As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden."
neu,"Well, if you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey, you never would have known a thing about it."
neu,Just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.
neu,"Well, it's become a habit with you."
ang,Don't be so stupid.
ang,What?
exc,"A woman's job is to allure the man.  Watch me a minute, will you?"
fru,"No, it isn't."
ang,"Oh, be quiet."
fru,Doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.
ang,"Adders don't snap, they sting."
fru,"I don't care, do you understand?  I don't care.  I don't care if they bark or roll about like hoops."
fru,Mind your own business.
ang,You're quite insufferable
fru,I expect it's because you're drunk.
fru,"On the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy."
ang,Shut up.
fru,"Not very funny, dear.  You'd better have some more brandy."
ang,Why?
fru,There aren't any people upstairs.  It's a photographer's studio.
ang,"Turn it on again, please."
ang,"Very well, if you insist on being boorish and idiotic."
ang,You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.
ang,Stop it.  Go away.  I hate you.
ang,"Listen?  Listen, indeed.  I am sick and tired of listening to you, damn sadistic bully."
ang,"I hate you.  Stop it.  Stop it.  I hate you, do you hear?  You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible."
ang,This is the end.  Finally and forever.  Do you hear me?  The end.
ang,"Oh Yes, I am."
ang,I am.  Let go of me.  You're a cruel fiend and I hate and loathe you.
ang,Thank God I realized what you are-- I'd never marry you again ever in my life. You're a cruel fiend and I hate you. You're a beast. You're a beast--I hate you. Stop it.  Stop it.
neu,"As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden."
neu,I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.
ang,What of it?
ang,"Well, what about me?"
neu,"Me, too.  Bored stiff.  You want some brandy?"
neu,No particular reason.  Anyhow they were very small ones.
fru,You can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on.
ang,"You needn't be so grand, just because you don't happen to want any yourself at the moment."
fru,Nothing.
fru,"Yes, it is."
fru,"Snap, snap, snap, like a little adder."
fru,Nonsense.  They have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.
fru,They snap.
ang,I'm not in the least drunk.
fru,"As I mentioned before, I have had three minute liquor glasses of brandy the whole evening long.  A child of two couldn't get drunk on that."
fru,"Oh, very interesting.  How about a child of four?  A child of six?  Or a child of nine?"
ang,"We could get a good debate going about this, don't you think?  Intemperate tots."
fru,Because it's late and it'll annoy the people upstairs.
fru,There are people downstairs I suppose?
fru,This is no time of the year for Tunis.
ang,I'll do no such thing.
ang,Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.
ang,Turn it off.
ang,"Amanda, listen. listen"
fru,"Very amusing, indeed."
ang,"You're a vile, tempered, loose living, wicked little beast and I hope to never see you again as long as I live."
ang,You're not going like this.
ang,You're not.
ang,Shut up. Shut up.
ang,I wouldn't-- I wouldn't marry--
ang,I wouldn't marry you if you came in crawling on your knees
ang,You're a evil vampire and I hope to God I never see you again as long as I live.
neu,"Hi, How can I help you?"
neu,"Sure, um"
neu,do you have two forms of ID with you?
neu,"I actually need two forms of ID. I need either a passport or a birth certificate, or social security card. I'm sorry."
neu,Well
neu,I- I can take your driver's license but I need another form of ID in order to process this paper work.
neu,"Um, that you would need to go home and get another form of ID and come back."
fru,"Well, I'm sorry sir but"
fru,you need to bring two forms of ID there is nothing we can do about it.
fru,"Well, it's actually-"
fru,"It's standard that you bring a couple of forms of ID, I'm sorry."
fru,"Well, I'm sorry, sir, but we're not responsible."
fru,"Yes, you did, thank you very much, but we're not responsible if you've forgotten something, and we need to have two forms of ID."
fru,"I'm sorry, but there is a lot of people waiting so you're just going to have to get in line again."
fru,"It just happens to people all the time, I'm sorry sir, but I can't make an exception for you."
neu,"I'm sorry, sir."
neu,there is nothing I can do.
fru,"I know sir, but we have to have two forms. There is nothing I can do about it, I'm sorry."
fru,"I'm sorry, sir. There is nothing I can do."
fru,"Well, if you had checked the web site it would have said."
fru,If you had checked the website it would have said that you needed two forms of identification.
fru,"Well, maybe you should"
fru,Right. So maybe you should go home now and get your paperwork and come back.
fru,"I'm sorry sir but there's a lot of people waiting. So if you won't move out of the way, then I'm going to have to call security."
fru,"I'm sorry, sir, it's not my choice."
fru,All right. Finally. Here you go.
neu,"Yea. I just want to get this done,"
neu,get my new license.
neu,"Um, no, I got my driver's license though."
neu,"Uh, sorry, I forgot them. I mean I've got to -"
neu,well is the dri-driver's license going to work?
fru,"Okay, so what are you saying? What-"
ang,"What? I- You telling me I waited in that huge line to go and sit down and get my number called, like after"
ang,three hours and
ang,Shouldn't they have like told us about that? I mean why - why would they make me go and wait three hours if I have got to go and do it again?
ang,"It's standard? I mean I don't work at the D.M.V. how am I supposed to know that, like, I stand in line, I get my"
ang,"I filled out the application right, didn't I?"
fru,Okay. What about - no -- how about you hold that and I'll - I'll go and I can come back-
fru,I've been waiting for three hours.
fru,This is ridiculous. Come on
fru,"I cannot go back in that line. I've got stuff I need to do, I mean-"
fru,That doesn't make any sense. Why?
ang,You- shouldn't you have like a sign or something maybe like up on the counter when you get the applica- maybe on the application
ang,"What web- I didn't go to a website - why would I need to - it's the D.M.V.. You come to the D.M.V., you wait in line for three hours, and then you go home."
fru,I waited in line now I'm ready to get my stuff and then go home.
fru,"God, oh my-"
fru,This is ridiculous.
sad,I don't want you to go.
sad,"I'm going to miss you too; I don't know what I'm going to do here without you. It's going to be so lonely, and so hard."
sad,I don't want to be a single mom.
sad,but
sad,It's dangerous; I mean how can you make sure that you'll
sad,I hope so.
sad,I hope so.
sad,It's going to be really rough.
sad,I'll send you lots of pictures.
sad,"Well, just promise me that you going to be safe."
sad,"I mean can't they put you in like, you know kitchen work or something where you won't get"
fru,It doesn't make any sense; I don't know why we have to be at war in the first place.
sad,"Will you write me letters, paper ones?"
sad,"Our baby needs a dad; you can't leave. Okay, you can't disappear."
sad,I'll miss you too.
sad,"I know, I know. I don't want to go either baby. I love you know. And I'm going to miss you a lot."
sad,"You won't be. I'll be back; I'll be back before you know it. All right, and"
sad,and
fru,"It's- It's dangerous anywhere, honey. I mean this is -this- I'm just going to go and we'll get it over with,"
sad,"You gotta take care of our baby for me, alright?"
sad,"I hope so, because I'm not going to be able to survive without all that. I don't know what I'm going to do."
sad,I've never been - I've never been away from you for two weeks let alone a year.
sad,there's people that thought it was the right thing to do so now we have to- we have to do what we have to do for our country
neu,"and it'll work out you know, go there and do that. Yeah, I'll be back"
sad,"Our baby has a dad, alright. Daddy is going to be back soon."
sad,"I want you to, you know, take lots of video; pictures and I can see you when I get back or while I'm there. I'm going to miss you."
exc,What? What? You look really happy what's going on?
exc,Finally did what?
exc,"Oh, my Gosh. Well, and did"
exc,Did she say yes?
exc,That's like the most definitive.
exc,I would have thought you would have told me that you were planning on doing this.
exc,"Yea, I guess so. Oh, my Gosh. Was she surprised?"
exc,"Oh, You did not."
exc,"Oh, my Gosh. that's so cute"
exc,"That's so romantic. Oh, my Gosh. She must have died. That's like one of those things you write into a magazine about like my boyfriend did this. Oh my God."
exc,She must have flipped out.
exc,Right exactly because you can't say no in front of thousands of people. [LAUGHTER]
exc,Did you bring her up on stage too?
exc,"Oh, my Gosh, that's so cute."
exc,Are your parents excited or...?
exc,"Ooh, that would be fun."
exc,"Oh my Gosh. I cannot believe you're getting married, that is so cool."
exc,"Golly, it just makes me all like romantic inside, like I really want that to happen to me. [LAUGHTER]"
exc,"Yay, well congratulations, that's so cool. [BREATHING] I can't wait."
exc,"Oh, you're never going to believe it."
exc,"Well, I finally did it"
exc,"Yes, she said yes. [LAUGHTER] I know"
exc,"Yes, yes. You know, she - she was like - I mean, she was happy, you know"
exc,"I - I think it was about time, I don't know, maybe. You know what, it's been it's been long enough now."
hap,"Oh, well, it was -- you know, we were at this- at this concert and yeah"
hap,so I-I talked to some of the crew before hand and-
hap,I-I did.
hap,"I know, so"
hap,I got to freak her out.
exc,"No, yes -- so"
hap,"Yea, that way she was guaranteed that she could not say no."
exc,"No, but it was good."
exc,"Yes, yes. [LAUGHTER]"
exc,"I know it was, I don't know I was really nervous but I'm really - I'm really glad."
hap,"Oh yes, they - they you know they love her and so I mean..."
exc,"Yea, yea, I'm not too sure where yet I guess you know, I kind of got to figure some stuff out here first"
exc,I know.
hap,"Oh, it will, obviously you know. But I know it's something - I don't know, you never really think about it happening, like before hand."
hap,"Sure. Oh, yes."
exc,"Yes, well, Thanks, thanks. Thank you. yeah"
hap,Hah.
neu,So how you feeling?
neu,"You've been doing a lot of work for it, right?"
neu,"Right, so the fact you doing the best that you can is -"
neu,"you know you shouldn't give yourself a hard time for that, it's the best you can."
neu,"Well, but you care about what you do, right?"
neu,"I understand that it's so frustrating but I know that you're here because you really want it you know and, and uh"
neu,"Well, I mean you're still here you've tried for this long so I think that says something all in itself."
neu,You are persistence. I mean that's important. that's
neu,"Well, you're talented so keep that in mind, you know, you shouldn't give yourself too hard of a time."
sad,I'm sorry.
neu,"That's- I mean. There are more factors then just whether you're good or not, you know what I mean like"
neu,"and the fact that you know there is always different types of things and what kind of people they want in the office and whether it's male or female or you know what I mean, like things are out of your control."
neu,So you should take that in consideration rather than giving yourself such a hard time.
neu,"You know and the fact you still here and still cooking, like it's good that you're thinking about it, that you're reconsidering."
neu,"But like, just because you're considering why it's been so difficult doesn't mean you should just stop."
neu,"Maybe you should take a little break from it, but I don't think you should stop."
fru,"Uhm, I don't know"
fru,I don't know what I'm going to do about this; I mean
fru,"I have got to get a job, you know? Like-"
fru,"Well, yea you know, I get my resumes and I mean I-"
fru,"I go out all the places I can, every place that'll give an interview you know."
fru,"But it's been so long, like what - what am I - what am I waiting -- I should probably just do something else, or"
fru,"I don't know, I mean why - why"
fru,"Yea, but it's - it's almost like it's not worth it you know, if I'm going to waste to have my life like trying to get a job, I mean once I actually do get the job it's like oh, retirement or something. I don't know, you know."
fru,"I don't even know if it's going to be worth it because I can't break myself in, you know like I can't - can't even get a foot in the door you know."
fru,"Yea, it says I'm stupid enough to be trying this long and not move on somewhere else."
fru,"I mean, I can't- I can't be persistent forever, you know, you can't not have a job forever, you know, I've got- I've got to do something, I've got to make money and get food on the table."
fru,"I mean, maybe I'm not, you know. I don't have a job. Maybe - maybe I'm not as good as-as I thought I was and"
fru,I just got a whole skewed opinion on just how this is supposed to work out and
sad,"I don't know, it's just not, I don't know - I don't know what to do really, you know, I'm just thinking"
fru,"maybe - maybe take up painting, I don't know, you know."
fru,"Do something that I don't have to go out and do something, stay at home, I don't know."
fru,Seems like the only option at this point because obviously the outer world has just rejected me of all possible employment.
fru,"I know, but I mean- if that's the - you know, I'm either like the worst at this or just the most unlucky person on the planet I mean this doesn't"
ang,this doesn't happen to a normal person.
fru,"I mean, I don't know, I don't see - I don't see any other way - any other way around it right now."
sad,Right. Thanks for talking to me.
neu,"Hi, can I help you?"
neu,"Oh, did you check? Did you make sure as it went around the second time that it-"
neu,"Okay. Well, um- the f."
neu,"Actually I'm looking here at the information, the flight that you were on we had some trouble with some of the baggage, it looks like a few peoples' bags didn't make it through. Um, so-"
neu,"Well, you can fill out this paperwork um- and if for some reason it shows up, we can bring it to you, but-"
neu,"Well, sometimes it's just late baggage or misplaced baggage and it comes out but it seems to be here and just I'm reading off of this that"
neu,Uh- it didn't make it into the second plane so it looks like there - they don't actually know what happened to it.
neu,"Um, well, sometimes there is just difficulties with loading on to the plane. Uh- There can be a theft or uh- some sort of you know mishap with a cart or something."
neu,"I- I- I understand, but um."
neu,Okay
neu,Right.
neu,"I understand that. Um- So I'm going to put down here that you looking for your baggage, but we actually can't, uh this bag is likely not going to show up so what we're going to do-"
neu,"Sometimes it gets stolen, sometimes it gets misplaced on another plane and"
neu,"they - they, it gets shipped to somewhere else and then it's stuck somewhere and then we have no way of tracking that."
neu,So we'll- what we'll do
neu,Right. Like I said sometimes a theft and things happen like that but we are willing to reim-reimburse you.
neu,"Um, so."
neu,"We have very tight security but we -uh- there are times when we just can't uh make sure there aren't absolutely no human error, you know"
neu,I'm sorry there is no guarantee on baggage.
neu,"I understand, so-"
neu,"all right, We've already checked back here for your baggage"
neu,and we will continue to look for it and because your paper-
fru,"I've already looked, thank you very much and because we've filled out paperwork if it shows up we will send it to you but otherwise what we can do is reimburse you for fifty dollar."
neu,"Well, it's- it's just sort of help with the fact uh that you lost some of your possessions and we rather do that than-"
neu,The airline can't afford to give you everything that is in that suitcase. and so-
neu,Well because lots of people get their baggage lost and we don't want to have false claims or anything like that so we have
neu,"we can give you fifty dollar to sort of make up for it, to compensate, and we can definitely let you know if it shows up but likely, more than likely-"
fru,I don't believe you should sue the airline company but we do have a policy uh- in which we can reimburse you and that's all we can do and I'm sorry I've done everything I can-
fru,There's other people waiting-
neu,Hi. Um-
neu,It seems that uh- my-my bag didn't make it out on the carousel.
neu,"Yes, yes, it's gone around like you know twenty times. It's been about a half hour."
neu,Okay. So what-what do I have to get you know
fru,I really - I really need that bag.
fru,"I mean -- I've been away for a while and- and now I've- I've gifts for- for you know friends and family I mean, I got stuff in the there"
fru,"Not going to show - well isn't like - wouldn't it just be at the airport, that, like, if it didn't get on the other plane"
fru,can they check there?
ang,"But we have the tags on. I mean like it wouldn't you know, if it got stuck somewhere it's like well this is nobodies bag I mean maybe you know look on the tag and"
fru,see where it came from originally. I mean it seems like-
ang,"Theft? Don't you know like all these people that are work - you keep like an eye on them, how can they get away with-"
fru,This is unbelievable. I've got
ang,you don't realize the stuff that I've got in that - I really need to get the suitcase okay
fru,"so if it's back there or something, if there is something you can do"
fru,"I need you to tell me because I really need to get the bag, okay?"
fru,You've already checked? Can you check again? [garbage]
fru,"Uh huh, yea, lost some of my possessions, yes, so if I lost maybe a shoe that was in the suitcase and like a carry-on"
fru,"that might be like fifty dollars okay, but this - I- [garbage] I had like thousands of dollars worth of stuff in that suitcase."
ang,The a- what? Talking about a core they can't afford it? I mean-
ang,I mean you're not helping me here. What do I have to do here? Do I need to sue the airline company is that what I should do
fru,because this is ridiculous?
fru,All right. I'm sick- I'm sick of this all right. I'm sick of you and keep your fifty dollar.
sad,"It doesn't make any easier, yes."
sad,"Oh, man. I'm so sorry."
sad,"It's going to be so rough, I'm sorry."
sad,Yeah.
sad,Totally.
sad,Yeah
sad,"Yes. Well, at least you have a lot of good memories."
sad,"She really cared about you, you know."
sad,And she was
sad,Yeah.
sad,Even if you still do she'll- she'll be there.
sad,Are you going to be okay?
sad,"It's going to be okay, I promise."
sad,Sure
sad,you shouldn't be alone
sad,Yes.
sad,Yes.
sad,Kathy died last night.
sad,"yeah, I mean, you know, it was a -"
sad,"I guess we saw it coming and she lasted a lot - a lot longer than, uh, they expected but you know, I mean when it actually happens it's just a lot harder."
sad,"I mean at least she was home, she wasn't in the hospital anymore,"
sad,"She was with- yeah  She was with Gary, and he said that she was just sitting there and went to sleep, closed her eyes, and that was it."
sad,"Yes. I mean, it's not as rough on me as it is on him but"
sad,"God, it's you know, we've spent so much time with them it's just really surreal, really weird that we're not going to be able to see her anymore and go"
sad,"out to- out to dinner you know and do the troops to California, I mean."
sad,"It's just that- I don't know, it's sort it's sort- of a weird thing you know"
sad,"not being able to see anyone again, who knows where they really went, you know. I mean, I guess we can just hope that wherever they are now if it's anywhere that it's better I mean."
sad,She was [garbage]
sad,"Yes, I mean she cared about all of us. She was great"
sad,so loving everybody you know.
sad,"Gosh, I just hate I just hate to see her go."
sad,We were all going take a trip to Europe you know.
sad,Yes.  [BREATHING] God.
sad,"I just -- I just don't get it, like there is just nothing you can do about it you know, it's like just out of your control and it"
sad,"just makes it that much harder to deal 'cause as much as you want to, you know, make her better, see her not in any pain, it's like, just I don't know, just has a mind of its own."
sad,Then she's gone.
sad,"Well, you know I appreciate you coming over and talking to me, I mean it definitely helps"
sad,to talk to somebody but
sad,"It's just going to take a while, I think."
sad,Ah.
sad,Thank you.
exc,"Oh, yeah? Have you gotten letters yet?"
exc,"Um, I don't know, where?"
exc,"Oh my Gosh, that's so cool."
exc,"[LAUGHTER] It's gotta be it, like-"
exc,"Oh my Gosh, that's so cool."
exc,big packet is gotta be the real thing. yeah
exc,"Oh my Gosh. I thought there was like, maybe going to be some, like I don't know if you are going to get in or not, so I'm really glad that you did."
exc,That's so cool.
exc,"Yeah, totally."
exc,So you're going to be right here in Los Angeles; that is so cool.
exc,So can we hang out?
exc,Yay.
exc,"Oh, yay. Thank you. [LAUGHTER]."
hap,No but that's an awesome school. That's so cool.
hap,"Oh, totally totally."
hap,you get to like be a part of that.
hap,"Like you get to be a part of that. Like the, like the- Like a cult."
hap,"[LAUGHTER] like a- like a- [LAUGHTER] No, but I mean like everywhere you go people know who you are."
hap,So you know what you are going to do there?
hap,"Okay. They have a lot of good schools, right?"
hap,"Yes, it's intimate."
exc,I know. It's so cool.
exc,"Fair for you, Wow, oh my Gosh."
hap,I will do the best I can.
exc,"Well, there are all kinds of awesome secrets so you'll really enjoy it. It's really great. I'm so glad."
exc,Yay

exc,"Hi. Thank you so much, you're a real person, right, you're not like a recording?"
exc,"Okay. Before I get into it, um your menu or whatever like where you choose the different thing depending on the-"
exc,"it leads you around in circles, you can't, there is no way to like get to a real person if you don't already know how to get to there."
fru,"So is there any way to like bypass that because that is so, like I've been going around in circles"
fru,"like press nine, press zero, press back to the menu, like I can't get through to what I'm supposed to get through to."
fru,"Okay. Oh, that would just make it so much better, 'cause I cannot handle it's just like oh, my God I can't sit here any longer and talk to this lady with this pleasant voice."
neu,"Sorry. Okay. Um-, yes"
neu,"Thank you very much. Um  So I have a charge on my credit card that, um, isn't mine."
neu,"Uh, I don't know where it came from and it's actually quite large, and I don't have the money for it so"
fru,it really freaks me out when I got my bill because it was like I don't -- I didn't spend this. This is not my charge.
neu,"Okay, it was um- at the [GARBAGE] sorry, it was at a department store, I think it was Macy's or something"
fru,"and it was like something like eight hundred dollars. I don't remember. It was just a lot and I have thing in front of me right now, but-"
fru,'Cause I-I just don't know how someone could have gotten my charge information
neu,I did buy one thing on ebay I don't know that might-
hap,Great.
hap,Yeah.
neu,"Right, right."
neu,"Okay, great."
neu,"Yeah, totally."
hap,Well thank you so much. You've been very helpful. I really appreciate it.
hap,Thank you very much bye.
neu,All right. Customer service this is Steve.
neu,"Right. No, yes I know. It is-It is a little frustrating."
neu,"I- I'll give you a little hint, next time if it asks if you're on a rotary phone you know, just stay on the line instead of - instead of hitting one or two to say if you're like on a touch tone"
neu,"pretend like your on a rotary phone, goes straight through to a person."
neu,I know they don't tell you that kind of thing.
neu,"Yea. All right. Well, let me-let me look it up here for a second. Uh, so i think"
neu,"Okay, Alright, yeah. I- I see it on here."
neu,"All right. Well, you know that's, that's what we have all of our protection plans for and everything like that so I mean it's"
neu,it- it'll work out fine.
neu,"Yes, we'll get- we'll get rid of it right now. I mean just we're going to have to have you, um, submit something you know, we're going to have to have you mail something in for us, okay."
neu,"So- So you can um find that application. You have the Internet, you can go to our website."
neu,Yeah. Yeah. You get the form right now. and- yeah
neu,"We could mail it to you as well, but-"
neu,"Right. You can go online, print it out, and just fill out the form and um- send it to us um- you know,  regarding the grievance and-"
neu,and it'll get taken off um- no problem you know
neu,Right. I mean we might
neu,Okay.
neu,"Uh, I mean have you been shopping around on the Internet and stuff? I mean that you gave-"
neu,"Uh-ha, I mean usually sites are pretty well protected but sometimes I mean information gets out, so"
neu,so it is a little a little hard in that situation if you want -- you know you can -um- we can- we can issue another credit card.
neu,"Yeah, yeah. Maybe we'll, uh-"
neu,it's a different number and everything
neu,Yeah. yeah.
neu,"Yes, um but  for- for that- for that charge we will need you to send something in but we can get you processed immediately for this, for this, for this new card. It still goes to the same address, right?"
neu,Okay. All right. Then we'll get it sent out there. And
neu,And you know just I mean be careful in the future if um
neu,if you're ever online or anything like that I mean just make sure it's a secure site and
neu,"and never you know, give it to anyone out, never even give out your number to any like unreliable company that you haven't heard of or anything like that, all right? Because, um, we want to- we definitely want to help you out, but-"
neu,you know it gets- it gets difficult you know so Alright.
neu,"Alright Yes, I'm sorry for all the inconvenience but we'll get it taken care of."
fru,"What do you want to do, argue with him?"
fru,You can't say that to him.
fru,"Can you prove it, how can you prove it?"
fru,To you it is and to me. You can talk yourself blue in the face but there is no body and no grave so where are you?
neu,I got an idea but what's the story?
fru,What do you want me to do; you're old enough to know your own mind.
neu,"Well, you want to make sure that your father isn't-"
fru,I'm just saying
neu,From father's point of you he isn't dead and you have no right to take his girl.
fru,"You can go on from there if you know where to go but I don't know where to go, see I don't know. So what can I do for you?"
neu,You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong with that.
fru,Have you asked Annie yet?
neu,How do you know she'll marry you? Maybe she feels the same way your father does.
ang,"Trouble is you don't see enough women, you never did."
ang,I just don't see why it has to be Annie.
fru,That's a good answer but it doesn't answer anything. I mean you haven't seen her since you went away to war it's five years.
fru,"I don't want a diagram. He thinks he's coming back. Chris, you marry this girl you're pronouncing him dead."
fru,"Do you know what's going to happen to your father because I don't, see?"
ang,What the hell is this?
ang,"What the hell is this, are you crazy?"
ang,What about the business? What is this?
ang,Must you be inspired?
ang,"Tell me, you'd leave the business?"
ang,"Well, you don't want to think like that."
fru,Just don't go thinking that way.
fru,"I don't understand you, do I?"
sad,"Yea, I can see that."
sad,I don't know. When it cracked he ran into the house and cried in the kitchen.
sad,No. I figured it was best to leave him alone.
sad,I could hear him right through the floor in my room.
fru,You know that Larry is not coming back and I know it. Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?
fru,"No I don't want to argue with him, but it's about time he realized that nobody believes Larry is alive anymore."
fru,"Why -- why shouldn't he dream of him? Walk around, waiting for him at night I mean do we contradict him, do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore that we haven't had hope for years now?"
ang,We've got to say it to him.
ang,"For God sakes it's been three years, nobody comes back after three years, that's insane."
fru,All right. All right. Listen to me.
neu,You know why I brought Annie here don't you?
neu,You know.
neu,I'm going to ask her to marry me.
fru,No it's not only my business.
fru,So it's all right then I'll go ahead with it?
ang,See it isn't just my business-
fru,She's not Larry's girl.
ang,"I don't know why but every time I reach out for something that I really want, I have to pull back 'cause someone else will suffer. My whole bloody life, time after time after time."
ang,To hell with that.
neu,I wanted to get this settled first.
neu,"Well, if she does then that's the end of it. From her letters I think she's forgotten him."
sad,"I don't know, I'll find out. Then we'll trash it out with dad, right? Mom, don't avoid me."
fru,So what I'm not fast with women.
fru,Because it is.
fru,"I can't help it I know her best. I mean lived next door to her my whole life. These years when I think of a wife, I think of Annie."
sad,"If I can't do that here well, then I'll have to get out."
sad,"I'll get out. I'll get married and go live some place else, maybe New York."
ang,"I've been a good son too long a good sucker, I'm through with it."
ang,The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.
ang,"Yes, I like it and hour a day. If I'm going to grub for money all day long, at least in the evening I want it beautiful."
sad,"Yes, on this I would."
fru,Then help me stay here.
fru,I know I know mom. All right. Just help me stay here.
fru,"Well, I am thinking that way."
ang,Why did he invite her here?
ang,She's been in New York three and half years why all of a sudden-
ang,Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.
ang,He's not going to marry her.
ang,What's going on here Joe?
ang,-She's not his girl Joe; she knows she's not.
fru,"Then why is she still single, I mean New York is full of men, why isn't she married? Probably a hundred people told her she's crazy but she's waited."
fru,"She knows what I know, that's why. She's faithful as a rock. In my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right."
fru,"Nobody in this house dares take her faith away Joe. Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother."
ang,"I want you to act like he's coming back, both of you. Don't you think I haven't noticed since he invited her, I won't stand for any nonsense"
fru,"Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself. And laugh -- laugh at me but"
sad,I need you to believe with me; I can't stand all alone.
fru,"Even last week there was a man who showed up in Detroit missing longer than Larry, you read it yourself."
fru,Just you above all need to believe.
fru,Don't stop believing.
fru,I can't help it.
neu,"Well, maybe he just wanted to see her again."
fru,"What do you mean? He lived next door to the girl all his life, why wouldn't he want to see her again?"
fru,"Don't look at me like that, he didn't tell me any more than he told you."
neu,How do you know he's even thinking of it?
neu,"Well, so what?"
neu,You can't read her mind.
fru,How do you know why she has waited?
fru,"Look it's a nice day, what are we arguing for?"
fru,What do you want me to do about it?
fru,But Kate
fru,Calm yourself.
fru,Calm yourself.
fru,All right. All right. Calm yourself.
ang,"What does that mean, me above all?"
ang,Look at you -- look at you shaking.
fru,"What have I got to hide? What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?"
hap,It's all right.  It's a good thing.
hap,"You know, it's lovely here, the air is sweet."
hap,"No, not sorry.  But, um. But I'm not gonna stay."
hap,"I knew they would, your mother anyway."
neu,"Well, from her point of view, why else would I come?"
hap,I guess this is why I came.
hap,"Well, you started to write me"
hap,Every day since.
sad,"Well, what's wrong?  I mean, even in your letters there was some--something ashamed."
sad,It wouldn't work this way.
sad,Do you still feel that way?
sad,"'Cause you mustn't feel that way.  Because you have a right to everything you have, Chris.  Everything, you understand that?  Me too."
sad,"I mean, and your money, there's- there's nothing wrong with your money.  I mean, your father put hundreds of planes in the air.  A man should be paid for that."
hap,What'll I do with a fortune?
hap,"I know, it went out of style, didn't it?"
fru,"The trouble is, I planned on sort of sneaking up on you on a period of a week or so.  But they take it for granted that we're all set."
exc,I'm embarrassing you and I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I wanted some place we'd never been before.  A place where we'd be brand new to each other.
exc,You felt something that far back?
exc,"Ann, why didn't you let me know?"
sad,Let's drive someplace.  I want to be alone with you.
sad,No.  Nothing like that.
sad,"Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me."
sad,"Well, I lost them."
sad,Just about all.
sad,It takes some time for a guy to toss that off.  'Cause they weren't just men.
sad,"For instance, this one time, it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.  I put them in pocket.  It's only a little thing, but those are the kind of guys I had."
sad,"They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  I mean, a little more selfish and they'd have been here today."
sad,"I got this idea watching 'em go down.  Everything was being destroyed, see, but it seemed that one new thing was made.  A sort of responsibility.  Man for man. You know what I mean?"
sad,"To show that, to bring that onto the Earth again, like some kind of monument and everyone can feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him."
sad,"Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here. I mean, the whole thing to them seemed like it's sort of a bus accident.  I went to work with Dad and that rat race again."
sad,"And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody had changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator."
sad,"I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta realize that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've gotta be a little better because of it."
sad,Otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of that.  And I guess that included you.
neu,I want you now Annie.
neu,Fine.
neu,What flashlight?
fru,That's not your flashlight.
fru,It's ours; it's mine too.
fru,But you kept saying my flashlight as if somehow it's just yours. I mean how is it supposed to make me feel?
neu,Yea.
neu,I'm cold.
fru,It's after eleven. Let's just go home.
fru,There is no point in coming down here.
fru,That's my point.
fru,So let's go.
neu,Not particularly.
fru,"I don't, it's just stupid."
fru,"Pass up what? These little fish swim onto the beach flop around and swim away, and then they die."
fru,What are you so excited about? I mean it's not a moon landing we're talking about here it's fish. It's a fish nobody even eats.
fru,Augie
sad,I'm just not.
neu,Yes.
ang,"Last year you'll also remember our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got into a big fight over nothing, and we didn't see the Grunions."
fru,We didn't see them the first time either.
neu,That's the wind.
neu,About what?
fru,It's ridiculous.
exc,What time is it? They're supposed to run around midnight.
exc,"God, this great, isn't it? Like look at the night we go here, it couldn't be better."
exc,How you doing?
exc,"Is that -- is that, no? Was that just foam? I can't even tell."
exc,"Although, I guess you can't tell it probably isn't them. Probably be unmistakable don't you think?"
exc,How you doing? You know what I forgot? I forgot to bring my flashlight. How - how could I forget to bring my flashlight? How could I be so stupid?
fru,"You know the flashlight, the silver one, there is only one, isn't there?"
fru,Who's is it?
exc,"You cold, you want my jacket? We should've - we should've brought our blanket, our blanket, how could we forget to bring the blanket?"
exc,"Oh, a six-pack, that's, should've brought a -- a six-pack be just the ticket right now. How could I forget,"
exc,"oh man. Like a kid, it's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped."
exc,You think they can hear us talk or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?
fru,"Are you kidding, we'd miss it. We, we just got here. What's the point in coming down here if we just turn around and go home?"
exc,"Honey, this is a natural phenomenon. I mean it only happens once a year."
exc,"Think about the people in Kansas, they- they'd have to get a plane ticket and hotel reservations to see this. We live forty minutes away it's too good to pass up."
exc,"Yea, but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives. I mean all that flopping is laying eggs or what do you, mating or spotting or something like that."
exc,"This is a big night for these guys, life's last orgy."
fru,Yes they do.
exc,"Okay. But it's fish that do something none of the other fish do. Like the swallows returning to Capistrano, or the Lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs"
exc,"you know there is like, there is a certain mystery here, a magic, a bit of the unexplainable. I don't see how you cannot be interested."
fru,"And then last year I remember specifically you were so excited that you stubbed your toe on the way pushing me out of the house, and you didn't even notice until we got in the car."
fru,We just weren't in a good spot; this is a much better spot. I've got good instincts for these things.
exc,"There is that, oh no that's just seaweed, isn't it?"
exc,"This is, this is great, isn't it? I wouldn't miss this for anything. Now listen to this, I know you're not interested but just listen."
exc,"Out there somewhere there is this huge mass of silver fish headed this way,"
exc,"they don't why, we don't know why. They didn't take a vote or anything; they didn't get a map or an invitation."
exc,"Just all as one. This little time sensitive firecracker, instinctual firecracker in their body just went off and all as one they turned and formed a line as long the California coast and started swimming. They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters."
exc,"It's single mindedness, with no mind, it's urgency that's pure urge, they don't know what drives them. They don't ask it a name or ask it a question,"
exc,"they just turn as one and start the swim and brings them right here to this spot where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death."
exc,Look at me; I'm giving myself goose bumps all my hairs are popping up.
fru,It's ridiculous.
ang,Goddamn it Augie don't ask me that. I hate it when you ask me that. You always ask me that. It's insulting.
ang,We just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.
fru,For heavens sake we are not going to see the Grunions.
fru,"We never do, do we? I mean have we ever?"
fru,"Twice is every time we've tried, that's ever."
fru,"No we won't; it's pointless. It's like waiting up to see Santa Claus,"
ang,I mean I feel like my whole life is going to be spent standing on the beach waiting for the fish to show up with my eyes open and my hands clasped expectantly and the fish won't show up.
fru,You don't understand anything I'm saying.
ang,"I did want to see them, I always do. I mean I keep thinking that this is going to be the time and it never is."
fru,For heavens sake this isn't about fish.
sad,Do you remember the first time we came to see it? It was about four years ago right after we got married.
sad,"We thought I was pregnant and we opened a bottle of champagne but no glasses, you asked me to dance, we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork."
sad,And when we were dancing you said the softest most intimate things to me right into my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them
sad,"and I remember thinking that this is it you know. At last, at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be"
sad,"Just dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle."
sad,I'd rather not remember some things. I would rather not hope for some things.
sad,No.
sad,No.
fru,No.
fru,No.
fru,No.
fru,I want something to turn out the way that it supposed to.
fru,"This? What, what is this? This isn't even anything."
fru,"I'm sure, this is standing on the beach, this is waiting, this is fighting."
sad,"Well, but this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like."
fru,I mean it's -- this is just this. I mean it includes a lot and everything but isn't something else. Do you have any idea what I'm trying to say?
sad,"I know that you meant this to be special and nice, and there's the sand and the moon and everything but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else."
hap,Don't be ridiculous. I mean don't you know that?
sad,"You're the one who probably wishes he was with someone else, someone who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard."
hap,"Well, I guess we don't need glasses."
sad,"Augie, I'm sorry."
hap,Or not.
neu,Hmm.
neu,So what do you think?
neu,What I was saying.
neu,Certainly it's not. Slightly exaggerated scientific fact.
fru,"Carla, can I ask you something? Don't take this wrong but are you having your period?"
fru,"Well, what's bugging you?"
fru,"There is nothing to it, we come here, the Grunion arrive, then do their little fish business, we go oh ah look, they go home, we go home."
fru,Why not?
fru,We've missed them twice; that's not ever.
neu,"Well, we'll see them this year."
fru,I thought you wanted to see them.
fru,No of course not.
fru,All right. I've been trying to work this backwards but I cannot seem to pinpoint the moment that we took a turn for the worst.
neu,"You were fine during the phone call from Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was no problem, let's see, I took a shower, you watched the news, you said"
neu,"""the Grunion are running tonight,"" I said ""great, let's go, I feel lucky,"""
neu,"okay so I'm getting on my jacket and putting out the animals, getting the car out of the garage-"
exc,"It was in the car, right? Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker you said, let's get some champagne and I said times are wasting or something like that, right?"
exc,"Of course, I see it now; you want this to be like that other time, right? That's it, right?"
neu,"Yea. Okay, sure, no. I see. Listen, you want to dance?"
neu,You want to go get some champagne?
neu,Take off our shoes?
neu,Get married again?
fru,What? What? You want a divorce?
fru,A vacation?
fru,"A new carpet? A poodle, a ice cream, backrub, a suicide pact, what, what Carla, what the hell do you want?"
ang,"Well welcome to the human race, all right. Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed? You think I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish?"
fru,"No, no, just like you I thought it was going to be all like peaches and roses and sand in our toes, and wind in our hair, and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'll have three, fat, rosy kids and ha-ha baby the joke is on us"
fru,"'cause you know what you get Carla, you know what you get? This."
sad,"No, I know. Me neither."
sad,Maybe if you were with somebody else too.
sad,"No, I know. But still, I know I don't make you happy."
hap,"Now that you mention it. No, I don't."
hap,I don't know it seemed like a pretty good spot to me. Look at the moon - view the moon view I got from here.
hap,What have we got here?
hap,"Shh, if we're very quiet the fish might come."
hap,Or not.
exc,What are we going to do?
hap,Now and always sweet.
exc,Oh. It sends shivers down my spine.
hap,Behave exquisitely.
hap,"Yes, I should probably to a court curtsey."
exc,Who's they?
sad,"Oh dear, should we like that?"
hap,Which particular one?
hap,"Oh Charles, that was his name Charles. It did wiggle so beautifully."
hap,I know you did. You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal; I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.
hap,It went on intermittently for days.
hap,It burned my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.
hap,The manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor biting and scratching like panthers.
hap,"Oh it was ridiculous, completely ridiculous."
hap,And very much sillier.
exc,Hello? Hello? What? Wrong number.
hap,With the most perfect poise.
hap,"Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's is happy, do they?"
sad,Oh darling don't say that.
hap,Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing love?
hap,What does it all mean that's what I ask- that's what I ask myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth?  Good God what does it all mean?
exc,"You mustn't be serious my dear one, that's just what they want."
exc,flippancy brings out the acid in their damned sweetness in light.
exc,"Certainly you must, we figures of fun all right."
sad,"No, that desire will fade along with our passion."
exc,"Yes, yes, with all his might."
exc,"No, no it isn't, death is very laughable, such a cunning little mystery, all done with mirrors."
exc,So is everyone else in the long run.
exc,"Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers, let's blow our trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can. Like quite idiotic, very small, school children. Let's savor the delight of the moment."
exc,Come kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.
hap,You remember that awful scene we had in Venice?
hap,"That was a rouser, wasn't it?"
hap,I'll never forget his face.
exc,You knew there was nothing in that.
exc,"Presents, just a trivial little broach."
neu,No it wasn't. It was very pretty I still have it and I wear it often.
neu,"No I didn't, you worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination."
neu,What of it?
neu,"It gave him a lot of pleasure, it didn't hurt me any."
neu,"Well, if you hadn't been so nosey and suspicious you never wouldn't have known anything about it."
fru,I'm bored of this conversation.
neu,No thanks.
neu,It just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.
neu,"Well, it's become a habit with you."
ang,What?
neu,No I'm just making myself fascinating for you.
fru,"Oh, no it isn't."
ang,Be quiet.
ang,I don't care. Do you understand? I don't care. I don't care if they bark or roll about like hoops.
neu,"Yes, I did quite a lot."
ang,Oh be quiet.
fru,"Very well, if you insist on being boorish and idiotic."
ang,You are far too temperamental. Try to control yourself.
ang,Stop it. Stop it. I hate you.
ang,"Listen indeed. I'm sick and tired of listening to you, damn sadistic bully."
ang,"Stop it. Stop it. I hate you, do you hear? You're overbearing and conceited and utterly impossible."
ang,"This is the end, do you hear? The end finally and forever."
ang,Oh yes I am.
ang,"Yes, I am. Let go of me you're cruel fiend and I hate and loathe you. Thank God I realized who you really are before I would ever, ever marry you again. I would never marry you again. I'd rather die in torment."
ang,You're a beast. I hate you. Stop it. Stop it.
neu,"As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden."
ang,I knew nothing of the sort. You took presents from him.
ang,You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.
ang,You let him kiss you; you said you did.
ang,What about me?
neu,I have a little I think.
neu,"No particular reason. Anyhow, they are very small ones."
neu,You can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on.
fru,Nothing.
neu,"Going out somewhere, dear?"
neu,"As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true."
fru,"Snap, snap, snap, like a little adder."
fru,Oh nonsense they have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.
fru,They snap.
neu,"Tell me, did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?"
ang,What riotous time you must have had.
ang,"No restraint at all, very enjoyable, never had much anyhow."
ang,"We can get a good little debate going about that, don't you think? Intemperate tots."
neu,All right. I will.
neu,Better turn that off I think.
fru,I'll do no such thing.
ang,Turn it off.
ang,"Amanda, listen. Listen."
ang,Very amusing indeed.
ang,"You're a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast and I hope I never see you again as long as I live."
ang,You're not going like this.
ang,You're not.
ang,Shut up.
ang,Shut up.
ang,I wouldn't marry you again if you came to me on your bended knees. You're a evil minded little vampire. I hope to God I never see you again as long as I live.
neu,What's wrong?
fru,"No, no, no, no, no, no. The lady over there, she told me to fill out the front and she said to wait in this line."
fru,I don't know. Some lady. Sonya or something.
fru,"Excuse me? No, no. I waited in the line over there.."
fru,and she told me to come over here and she said to fill out everything on the application and I did that.

sad,"But she has you. I mean, that's what you're there for. You're my right-hand man."
sad,It's going to be okay.
sad,"No, I have to go."

sad,It's all I ever knew how to do. I can't quit now.
sad,"Well, we- we tell her mommy's going on va- on a trip for for- a while."
sad,Don't do that to me.
sad,"It's hard enough already, Brian, I can't."
sad,I know.
sad,"I didn't expect this to happen. I never planned for this. Some things you just don't plan for, you know."
sad,"I'm sorry, babe."
sad,I'm so sorry.
neu,All right.

exc,"Joe's gone. -where did he go, you know?"
exc,"And I'm like oh, he went to the- -the bathroom, but he didn't tell me, I didn't even notice him leaving. And all of a sudden, I swear to God, I'm sitting there and-"
exc,he comes up onstage-- And the entire cast everyone just like
exc,goes up there and everyone's clapping and he's standing there and they put a spotlight on him.
exc,"And I'm like freaking out. I'm like what the hell's going on, you know. I don't know what's going on. And so he's like standing there and then all of a sudden they give him a microphone-"
exc,"he asked me to marry him, like- onstage. I was like, I couldn't believe--and I had to walk up there and I was, like I think I tripped or something."

fru,So I'll have to wait twenty five years-
fru,"-just going and auditioning and auditioning and rejection after refection, it's like--"

fru,I feel like I'm not doing anything. Like I'm not giving anything into this world.
fru,"Yeah, but what if I never make it? What if I studied all my life, this theatre, this acting, and I'm never going to get anywhere. I'm never going to be able to have a job."

neu,You could. You could. We just--
neu,we're just pooling our funds together.
neu,You don't owe me anything.
neu,"You are, you're going to class, you're learning, you're getting better. When you finally get that role you're going to be prepared."
neu,"Oh my God, Anna, you're still young. Don't even think about that."
neu,"You're only twenty five, okay? Some people don't start until they're thirty five."
neu,Yeah.
neu,What would you do- What would you do if you didn't? You can go to law school.
neu,See? So you can't just quit now.

fru,"Look sir, I've been waiting for about an hour and my luggage still hasn't come. What's going on?"

fru,I had my luggage transferred here from Paris to L.A. and now I'm here and I need to be working and I have all my stuff in there.
fru,"Well, that's what I'm asking you. What--I don't know what happened to it."
ang,"Wait, sir. You're- You're completely not--what do you mean, stole it? How can they just steal it from an airplane? It was up in the air?"
fru,Okay. All I know is that I am supposed to have my language here right now. Right now. And it's not there. And you're supposed to help me because you work at the airport. So give me my luggage or tell me where the hell it is.
ang,"What do you mean, if it shows up? No, I need it now. I have my keys, I have my wallet, I have my money. I have thousands and thousands of dollars worth of stuff in there."
ang,Not to mention I have my work in there.
ang,"And what if- what if it is lost? Well, what are you guys going to do for me?"
ang,Fifteen percent?
ang,What? There- There's hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of stuff in there.
fru,"No, no, no. You don't understand. This is--these are my belongings in the luggage. And I went to Paris."

ang,"Well, get- I want the C.E.O. then."
fru,"I'm sorry, Mrs. Rosenkrantz, but uh- I don't know what to tell you."
fru,Did you- Did you check with the lost and found?
fru,"Maybe it got lost. Did you think about that, mom?"
neu,"Oh, not--we didn't lose it; maybe the airport lost it. Maybe someone stole it."
fru,"No, I mean, maybe in the little--going around thingy thing where bopper stole it from there."
fru,Okay. What can we do is we can get your name and information and if it shows up we can send it to you so-- Wherever you stay
fru,"Well, I'll have you fill out some paperwork and see if you can get started on something."
neu,and when you sign your ticket we could replace about fifteen percent of what's in the bag.
neu,Up to a limit of twenty five dollars.
fru,"Whoa, maybe you should uh- have thought of a better way to send it than just in a bag, hmm? Did you think about that?"
neu,"I think that's kind of stupid, that you put a hundred thousands of dollars in the bag."
fru,Did you lock- Did you lock it even? You probably didn't even lock it.
neu,"Okay, let me get him.Oh, guess who the supervisor is? It's me."
neu,"What, do you have questions?"
sad,Okay.

sad,"You know, he had that really pretty girlfriend for like about a year and-"
sad,Kelly. Kelly Uveny.
sad,They talked about getting married and--
sad,"Yeah. But then when he got cancer and it got bad, you know, she just took off and-"

fru,"What, you're going to argue with him?"
fru,You can't tell him that.
fru,We can't. It just won't work.

fru,What?
neu,Why?
neu,"Well, that's only your business, Chris."
fru,"Well, it is. I mean, what do you want me to do? You're grown up; you know what's going on in your mind."
fru,"Well, you better make sure your father's not- No- I'm just saying."
fru,"Yeah, well I ignore what I got to ignore."
fru,And she-she's Larry's girl.
fru,"Well, from your father's point of view she is. I mean, he's still alive. You've got no right to take her."
fru,"'Cause listen, I'm telling you, I don't know where to go from there. Do you?"
fru,What do you want from me?
neu,You're a considerate fella and there's nothing wrong in that.
neu,There's nothing wrong with it.
fru,You didn't ask her yet?
fru,"You know, the trouble is you've never had enough women. No, you never did."
fru,I don't understand why it has to be her.
fru,"That's a good answer, but it doesn't answer anything."
fru,"I mean, you haven't seen her since the war. I mean, it's been five years."
fru,"No, I don't want a diagram."
fru,"He thinks he's coming back. You go-go on and marry her, I mean, you're pronouncing her dead. And what's going to happen to your father, huh? I don't know. Do you?"
fru,"Just, listen. Give it more thought, is all."
fru,You're what-you're going to leave the business? But you can't do that. What the hell is this?
fru,"Oh, you have to be inspired."
neu,Tell me something.
neu,You'd leave that business.
fru,You can't do that.
fru,"All right, but you can't do that. You can't talk like that."
fru,"We've worked all our lives for you. Only for you, Chris. The whole shootin' match is for you."
neu,I'm going to.
neu,"I don't know you, do I?"
neu,Yeah. I can see that.
neu,He saw it.
neu,He was out there when it happened.
neu,"Um, about four this morning. Uh- I heard a crack and I looked out and I saw him standing there."
neu,I don't know. But after it cracked he went back in the house and he cried in the kitchen.
neu,"No, I uh-, I figured the best thing to do was to leave him alone."
neu,I could hear it right through the floor.
neu,I guess he is.
neu,I don't know.
neu,"But I know one thing, mom. We've made a terrible mistake with dad."
neu,Being dishonest with him. That kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.
fru,"No, I don't want to argue with him, but it's time that he realized that no one believes that Larry's coming back anymore."
fru,We got to tell him that.
fru,"You know, for God's sakes it's been three years. No one comes back after three years. It's insane."
fru,"All right. Just- Sit down, mom. I want to talk to you."
fru,"All right. All right. Just come on, sit down."
neu,"You know-you know why I asked Annie here, right?"
neu,You know.
neu,I want to ask her to marry me.
fru,"Come on, you know that's not only my business."
neu,So it's all right. I'll just go ahead with it.
ang,"See, then it's not just my business. God, you have"
ang,"-Oh, you infuriate me sometimes. You know, it's not just my business too if dad throws a fit."
sad,"Every time I reach out for something I have to pull back because other people will suffer. My whole entire life, time and time after time."
ang,To hell with that.
neu,I didn't ask Annie yet.
neu,I wanted to get this settled first.
neu,Well then I guess it's over then. But from her letters I think she's forgotten him.
neu,"I'll find out. But then after it's all over we'll thrash it out with dad, right?"
fru,"Mom, don't avoid me."
fru,So what? I'm not fast with women.
neu,Because it is.
fru,I just-
neu,It just is. I-
fru,"I grew up with her. Okay. All these years, when I think of someone I want to be my wife I think of Annie. What do you want, a diagram?"
fru,"Okay. All right, then."
fru,"No, I've given it three years of thought."
neu,But if I can't have that here then I'll get out.
neu,I'll get out. I'll marry her somewhere else. Maybe New York.
fru,The business. The business doesn't inspire me.
ang,Yes. I like it an hour out of the day. If I have to grub for money all day long at least that evening I want it beautiful. I want a wife. I want a family. I want some kids. I want to build something I can give myself to.
ang,"Now, Annie's in the middle of all that."
neu,"Now, where do I find it?"
neu,Yes. On this I would.
neu,Then help me stay here.
neu,Okay. Just-
fru,"Yeah, I know, I know, just help me stay here, all right?"
neu,I am thinking like that.
neu,"No, you don't. I'm a pretty tough guy."
ang,Why did you invite her here?
ang,She's been in New York for three-and-a-half years. She don't just suddenly come and-
ang,You don't travel seven hundred miles just to see.
ang,It's got that about it.
ang,She's not Larry's girl. She knows that.
sad,"She's faithful as a rock, don't you know. In my worst moments I can think of her-"
ang,"Nobody in my house better ever dare-dare to challenge her faith. Maybe strangers, but not his father, not his brother."
ang,"Don't, don't laugh at me, don't laugh at me."
ang,"Look at it. Because why, when she came here and she slept in his room, the memorial broke into pieces. Look at it, look at it, Joe."
sad,"No, you've got to believe."
sad,You got to keep believing.
sad,I can't help it.
neu,"Well, maybe, maybe he just wanted to see her."
neu,How do you know he's even thinking about it?
neu,"Well, so what?"
fru,"Listen, kid-"
neu,You can't read her mind.
neu,How do you know why she's waited?
neu,"Look, it's a nice day. What are we arguing for?"
neu,Calm yourself.
fru,Calm yourself.
ang,All right. All right. Calm yourself.
fru,Okay. Just calm yourself.
ang,"Why me, above all?"
ang,Huh?
ang,Why me above all?
ang,"Look at you, you're shaking."
ang,What have I got to hide?
ang,"Huh? What the hell's the matter with you, Kate?"
hap,You're the only one I know that still loves his parents.
hap,"No, it's all right. There's nothing wrong in that, you know."
hap,It's really lovely here. The air is sweet.
sad,No. I'm not sorry. It's-
fru,"Well, for one thing, your mother so much has told me to go. [LAUGHTER]."
sad,"Well, you've been embarrassed ever since I came."
hap,"Well, I mean,"
hap,"from her opinion, why else would I come here?"
hap,"Well, I guess that's why I came."
hap,"I've been ready for a long, long time."
hap,Every day since.
hap,I don't know if I ever can forgive you for that. Why'd you wait so long? I sat in my room wondering if I was crazy for thinking about you.
hap,"Like Larry's brother. Do it like you, Chris."
sad,No. What is it? Is it your mother?
sad,"Well then tell me what's wrong. I mean, even in your letters there's something ashamed."
sad,You should tell me.
sad,"But, Chris, it wouldn't work like this."
sad,"Yeah, sure."
sad,How many?
sad,Geez.
sad,And you still feel that way?
sad,"Because you can't feel that way, never again, Chris. You hear me? Never. I mean, the money and me too."
hap,What am I going to do with a fortune?
hap,"Yeah. I know. It went out of style, didn't it?"
neu,You're not sorry you came?
neu,Well-
neu,What?
hap,"Oh look, um, well, the thing is, I was planning on, planning on sort of sneaking up on you over a week or so, and they-they take it for granted we're all set."
hap,"I, I guess that's why I asked you to come."
hap,"Oh, Annie."
hap,"Annie, I love you."
hap,I love you a great deal.
hap,I-I love you. I have no imagination. That's all I know how to tell it.
hap,"I'm embarrassing you. I didn't want to tell you it here. I wanted to go somewhere that would be brand-new to each other. It feels wrong here, don't you? This yard and this chair."
hap,I don't want to win you from anybody. I want you to be ready for me.
hap,You felt something that far back?
hap,Why didn't you let me know?
hap,"Give me a kiss, Annie."
hap,Give me-
hap,We're going to live now. I'm going to make you so happy.
hap,I kissed you.
sad,Let's drive somewhere. I want to be alone with you.
neu,"No, no, no, no. Nothing like that."
sad,"Yeah. I guess there is. I guess I was, but uh- it's going from me now."
sad,I don't know where to start.
sad,You know when I went overseas. I said I was in command of a company.
sad,"Well, I lost them."
sad,Just about all.
sad,It takes a little while to toss that off. Because they weren't just men.
sad,"For instance, one time, it had to have been raining several days. There was this one kid, he came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks. Put them in my pocket."
sad,"I mean, that's-that's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had. They didn't just die. They killed themselves for each other. And I mean that exactly. A little more selfish and they'd still be here today."
sad,"And I, and I thought something watching them go down."
sad,"Everything was being destroyed, see, but there was one new thing that was being created. A kind of responsibility, man for man. You understand me?"
sad,And to show that-to bring that onto the earth like some sort of monument standing right behind us where everyone could feel it and it would make a difference to him.
sad,And I came back here and it was incredible. There was no meaning in that here. The whole thing to them was a bus accident.
sad,And I went to work with dad and that rat race again. And I felt what you said-ashamed somehow. Because nobody was changed at all. It seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys.
sad,"And I felt wrong to be alive. To drive the car, to see the new checkbook, to see the new refrigerator. I mean, you can take those things out of the war. But you got to know that when you drive that car that that came out of the love a man can have for another man. And you got to be a little bit better because of that."
sad,"Otherwise, what you have here is loot; and there's blood on it."
sad,And I didn't want to take any of it.
sad,And I guess that included you.
hap,"Annie,"
hap,"Annie, I'm going to make a fortune for you."
sad,Fine.
ang,"I don't understand why you're always saying oh, it's mine, it's mine. It's not like it's just your flashlight. I mean, how do you think that makes me feel?"
sad,Not particularly.
sad,I don't know. I just don't.
ang,Pass up what? A bunch of fish. They swim up to the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.
fru,"I don't know why you're getting so excited. I mean, it's not like the landing of the moon or something. It's just fish. Fish that nobody eats."
fru,"Oh, God, Augie."
fru,"Yes, and if you also remember, I got sand in my panties. We got into an argument about nothing. You got a sore throat and we never saw the grunions."
fru,"No, for God's sakes, we've never seen the grunions. We're not going to see them."
exc,"Hey, what time is it? They're supposed to run around midnight, right? God, this is great, isn't it?"
exc,Look at the night we got; couldn't be better.
exc,"You know actually, I wanted to go a little further up the coast to get away from all the, the people and the lights, and uh- but I thought we'd miss it. Hey, how you doing?"
exc,"Oh, is that-is that-now, is that just foam, uhh, I can't even tell."
exc,"Oh, though if I can't tell it probably isn't them, right? It probably would be unmistakable, wouldn't you think? Hey, how you doing?"
exc,"Oh, do you know what I forgot? I forgot my flashlight. How could I be so stupid. Oh, I-I should have brought my flashlight."
exc,"Uh- you know, the flashlight. The silver one. There's only one, isn't there?"
exc,We should have brought our flashlight. I can't believe we forgot to bring it.
exc,I hope the moon stays out.
exc,"Hey, do they always run during a full moon? I can't remember if it was full last year. Do you remember?"
exc,"We should have brought the blanket. Oh, why didn't we bring the blanket? Our blanket."
exc,"You know what would be good right now? A six-pack. Ah, I can't believe I forgot a six-pack. A six-pack would be just the ticket right about now."
exc,I'm so stupid. I'm like a little kid. I-it's amazing I get out of the house with my fly zipped. Oh- [LAUGHTER].
exc,I wonder if they can hear us talk. Or hear the vibrations in the sand when we move.
neu,Do you want my jacket?
neu,Right.
neu,"Yeah, that's my point too."
exc,"No. No, no, no, that's not my point. My point is there's no point in coming down here if we just turn around and leave."
neu,"I mean, don't you want to see it?"
neu,Why not?
fru,"We just weren't in a good spot, all right? This is a much better spot. I have a good instinct for these things. Look, is that-"
exc,"I wouldn't miss this for anything. I mean, think about this. Okay, I know you're not interested, but just think about this for a minute."
exc,"And they all, all as one, turned as one and formed this line as big as the California coast and started swimming this way. Swimming as if that's the only thing that matters."
exc,"You know, they didn't ask it a question. They didn't, they didn't take a vote. They didn't have an invitation or a map; they just started swimming as one."
exc,"its single-mindedness with one mind. Urgency that's pure urge. You know, they don't give it a name."
exc,"They don't ask it a question. They just, they just, they don't know what drives them. They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them to here"
exc,"where we stand for a massive celebration of sex and death. Oh, God, I'm giving myself goosebumps. Look, I'm all-all my hairs on my arms is sticking up."
neu,About what I just said.
neu,About what?
ang,"Augie, Goddamn it, don't ask me that. You always ask me that. Why do you ask me that? I hate it. It's insulting."
fru,"Look, it's-we just-we're looking at this evening in a different way, both of us. We both have different ideas of it."
fru,"Look, Augie, we've never seen them. They're never going to come."
ang,Like I feel like my whole life I've been just standing on this beach with my hands clasped waiting for these fish to show up and these fish never show up.
fru,I do.
fru,"Look, I did. I always do. But it's like every time I try nothing ever happens."
fru,"For God's sake, Augie, this is not about fish."
sad,Do you remember the last time we came here?
sad,We thought I was pregnant.
sad,You brought a bottle of champagne.
hap,We took off our shoes and we danced barefoot in the sand. Under the moon.
hap,And you whispered so intimately in my ear so I could feel your words.
hap,"Oh, that moment-that was it."
sad,"I told myself finally, this is how happy I'm supposed to be."
hap,Dancing barefoot in the sand. Drinking out of a bottle of champagne.
sad,I don't want to remember something.
sad,Hope for some things.
sad,No.
sad,No.
sad,"No, no."
fru,No.
fru,No.
ang,No.
fru,No.
fru,I want things to turn out the way that they're supposed to be.
fru,This what? What is this? This is nothing.
ang,"No, it's not. It's standing on the beach waiting and fighting."
sad,Things have never turned out anything the way that I thought they would be.
sad,it's not something else. Do you know what I'm trying to say?
sad,"I know you are, Augie, and I know you wanted this evening to be nice, but I can't help thinking of being somewhere else."
sad,I didn't say that.
fru,"Augie, anything I do I'd rather be doing with you."
fru,"God, don't you know that? I mean, you're the one that probably wants to be with somebody else. Somebody that didn't take herself so seriously, could enjoy herself more."
hap,"Well, I guess we're just in the wrong spart-spot with the right person."
hap,I noticed that. It's beautiful.
hap,You can see right over the water.
hap,At least we won't need glasses.
hap,Maybe this is the right place after all.
sad,"I'm sorry, Augie."
neu,About what I was just saying.
fru,It certainly is not. It is slightly exaggerated scientific fact.
fru,"Well, I'm not the only one. Look at all these people."
fru,Are we talking about the same thing?
neu,"Carla, can I ask you something? Don't take this wrong, but are you having your period?"
fru,"Okay, then what's bugging you?"
fru,"There's nothing to it, alright? We come down here, the grunion arrive, they do their little fish business, we go ooh, ah, look at the fish, and then they go home and we go home."
neu,We're not seeing the grunions?
fru,We missed them twice. That's not ever.
fru,We'll see them this time.
fru,"God, I thought you wanted to see it."
fru,It's just fish. Nothing to get traumatized over.
fru,"I've been turning this thing over in my head trying to figure out when the point was when we took a turn for the worse, and I can't seem to pinpoint it."
fru,"You were fine during the phone call from Marge. Dinner was okay. Doing the dishes was no problem. Let's see. I took a shower. You were watching the news. You said Augie, I think the grunion are running. I said great, let's go. I feel lucky tonight."
fru,"And so I'm getting the animals, putting the animals out in the yard. I'm putting on my jacket, getting the car out of the garage-"
neu,Wait a minute. I got it.
fru,What? What? Do you want me to breathe in your ear?
fru,Do you want to get married again? What? What? Do you want to get a divorce?
fru,A vacation?
fru,A new carpet? A poodle?
ang,"A-a back rub, some ice cream, a suicide pact. What the hell do you want, Carla?"
fru,"Jesus, welcome to the human race."
fru,"No, I was just like you. I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and everything great. And the wind in our hair and the sand in our toes, and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves, and we'll have three big fat rosy kids. And oh God."
fru,"You know what you get? The jokes on us, baby. Because do you know what you get? Huh? Carla? Do you know what you get? You get this."
fru,"Yes, it is."
fru,Right.
fru,"No, I know. Me neither."
fru,"Well, I'm doing the best I can."
fru,"Yeah, maybe if you were with someone else too."
hap,"Actually now that you mention it, no, I don't."
hap,"Seemed like a pretty good spot to me. I mean, look at the view of the moon we've got from here."
hap,Look what we got here.
hap,It's not champagne.
neu,Are you still cold? Do you want to go home?
neu,Shh.
hap,If we're very quiet the fish might come.
hap,Or not.
neu,[BREATHING]
neu,Do you think it's them?
exc,Don't laugh at me. I'm serious.
sad,"Oh dear, well, shall we want that?"
sad,"Well, what if happens if one of us is to die? Does the one that's left still laugh?"
exc,"Thank you, dear. The same applies to you. Except that if I ever so much as catch you looking at another woman I'll kill you."
hap,Oh Charles. That was his name. Charles. He did wiggle so beautifully.
hap,yeah. And that was the first time you ever hit me.
hap,The manager came in and found us rolling on the floor and biting and scratching like panthers. [LAUGHTER]
exc,I know. Oh man. Couldn't believe it.
neu,"We're all right, aren't we darling? Whatever happens."
neu,Then I don't care.
exc,"things that should matter dreadfully don't seem to matter at all when one's happy, do they?"
exc,"[LAUGHTER]. You mustn't be serious, my dear one, that's what they want."
exc,"Ooh, certainly you must. We're figures of fun, all right."
exc,"Let's blow strumpets, blow-blow trumpets and squeakers and party as much as we can like small quite idiotic school children. Let's savor the delight of the moment. Come, kiss me darling, before worms pop in and out of your eye sockets."
exc,Remember that awful scene we had in Venice?
exc,"That was a rouser, wasn't it?"
neu,"Just a little perhaps, but it was nothing serious."
neu,"Well, it's true."
neu,It's become a habit with you.
ang,Don't be so stupid.
ang,What?
neu,"It's a woman's job to allure the man. Watch me, won't you, a minute?"
ang,"No, it isn't."
fru,"Adders don't snap, they sting."
fru,They sting.
ang,"I don't care. I don't care, do you understand? I don't care if they bark, if they roll over on the floor like hoops."
fru,Mind your business.
ang,You are quite insufferable. I suppose it's because you're drunk.
fru,You've always had a weak head.
fru,Do shut up. Shut up.
fru,I don't want to talk about this anymore.
ang,Turn it on.
ang,I will not. Go away. Go away. I hate you.
ang,"Listen, indeed. No, no, no, no. I am sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully."
ang,"Stop it, stop it, I hate you, I loath you, you are overbearing and conceited and utterly impossible."
ang,This is the end. Do you hear? The end. Now and forever.
ang,"Oh, yes I am."
ang,"Yes I am. Let go of me. I hate you and I loath you. God, I can't believe I just finally realized how you are. I am never marry you. Never. Never, never, never. I would rather die in torment."
ang,"Beast or brute cad, swine beast beast brute."
ang,"As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden."
ang,I knew nothing of the sort. You took presents from him.
ang,I remember it well. Bristling with diamonds. In the worst possible taste.
ang,You let him kiss you. You said so.
ang,What about me?
ang,"That's a nice point of view, I must say."
neu,Are you bored with this conversation?
neu,So am I. Bored stiff. Want some brandy?
neu,"I'll have a little, I think."
neu,"No particular reason. Anyhow, they were very small ones."
ang,You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want some yourself at the moment.
ang,"Really, Amanda."
ang,Nothing.
ang,"Going somewhere, dear?"
ang,"Yes, it is."
ang,They snap.
ang,did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?
ang,"I imagine that you let him kiss you quite a bit more then, didn't you?"
ang,You had a riotous-must have had a riotous time. No restraint at all. Very enjoyable. You never had much anyhow.
ang,I'm not in the least bit drunk.
ang,"Okay. As I mentioned before, I said I had three very minute liquor glasses. That's hardly enough to get a child of two drunk."
ang,"Well, I suppose the people downstairs then."
neu,This is no time of the year for Tunis.
ang,Turn it off.
ang,"Oh, very amusing, indeed. Amanda, listen-"
ang,Very amusing indeed.
ang,"You know, you're a vile, ill-tempered, wicked little beast and I hope that I never see you again as long as I live."
ang,"No, you're not going out like this. No you're not."
ang,"Oh, shut up. Shut up. Shut up."
ang,"I wouldn't marry you again if you came back crawling to me on your hands and knees because you're vile. You're a mean, evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never set eyes on you again."
neu,Is that a demand sir?
fru,"Sir, you completely filled this out wrong."
neu,No.  You filled out the back part.  You were supposed to fill out the front portion only.
fru,"No, no, no, no, no.  You're going to have to go back over on the other side-- --second door, up the stairs..."
fru,No I can't just transfer it myself sir.  You got to do this.  Everyone else is doing the same thing.
fru,Excuse me sir?
fru,I think you're being a little condescending.
fru,You need to go back over there and fill it out again.
fru,"No, no, no, because there are other people in line.  You have to go get a complete new application."
fru,"You will get your license, sir, you have to go fill out-- --another copy...excuse me?"
fru,Well not from this department you won't.
fru,Sir-
fru,Sir?  I'm going to ask you one more time and then I'm going to call my supervisor
fru,who will proceed to call-- security if you can't remove yourself--
fru,Really?
fru,"She's not actually in the building.  She's only on the phone. Sir, please leave this line immediately."
ang,Okay.  I'm going to call security. Security!
fru,"No, You cannot get your license.  You filled out the wrong part of the form."
ang,"This entire time you're fighting with me sir, you could've finished the form and already been half way-- No.  Get out."
fru,"Hey listen here missy, I've been in this line for an hour and now I'm finally here.  So you're going to take my application."
fru,It's not a demand it's a request.  Will you just take it?  Come on.
ang,What are you talking about?  It says fill out that part.
fru,Okay.
fru,Oh my God. Can you just transfer it yourself?
fru,You don't know! you can't write?  You don't know how to write?
fru,What's wrong with you people?  God.
fru,The information is on there.  Here I'll just fill it out right here.
fru,"This will take like a minute, okay? Jesus."
ang,I'm not going anywhere.  I'm staying right here.
ang,"Hey,uh-- Well that's too bad cause I'm getting my license right now."
fru,Give me my--
ang,"Hey, no, give me that back."
ang,-- No.  I'm not waiting...I'm not coming back again.  I don't have time to come back five days.
fru,I'll have a license.
ang,Yes I will.  I'll have this [GARBAGE]
fru,just as I want.  Ugh.
ang,Fine.  Call your supervisor.  Ask supervisor over
fru,and I'll tell her how you've been behaving.
fru,How would you like that hmm?
fru,"Oh, okay.  Wow."
ang,No.  I'm not going anywhere.  I'm staying here-- I am filling out right now okay just calm down. I'm filling out right now-- Just take the god damn piece of paper.
fru,I'm sorry she's--these people they just want to get their license--
ang,I did finish one.  Take it.
ang,What is wrong with you?
hap,Um.
hap,Why the sad face?
fru,Honey--
fru,You can't.  We need you.  I need you.
fru,I don't care about the money.
sad,Do this whole thing by myself?
sad,Carry her for nine months and then yes.
sad,It's not the same thing.  It's not like having you here.
sad,I can't do this.
sad,I'm sick of being strong-- --for us.
fru,You can say no?
fru,You could.  You really could.  You could-- --get into another line of work.  I could start working after Anna's born?
fru,I know.
sad,"and watch our child grow, see her take her first steps, her first words."
sad,You said two years.
sad,A whole year? --We're not talking about like a couple months here.  I mean this is a whole year.
sad,What could happen in a year?
sad,And this isn't the first time you know?  I mean you always...sending you off to different places and...
sad,I don't know if that's how I want to live my life.
sad,"Joe I'm serious I don't want to have to have a little girl to tell...asking every day where's daddy, where's daddy and have to tell her that he's away--"
sad,far away and he won't be here.
sad,I'm done.  I can't honey.
sad,It's over.
sad,Honey I can't do it anymore.
sad,I need you here.  Anna needs you.
sad,yeah.
fru,"Priorities honey, priorities."
fru,You're smart.  You could go back to school--
fru,finish your Master's that you were started never finished.
sad,Hey sweetie.
sad,Hey.
sad,"Uh, -Um"
sad,they need me out there sooner than I thought
sad,They want to deploy me next week.
sad,For--
sad,They said anywhere from two to three years.
fru,#NAME?
fru,"I don't want to go but,-"
fru,but they said they'd increase my pay by triple-there promotion.
sad,No.
sad,Honey you're not going to be by yourself--
neu,"We'll have internet set up, we'll get web cameras and everything.  My whole family's here too."
neu,"You can do it.  Alright?  You can, you can be strong, you can be strong for both of us alright?"
sad,I don't know what to do.
fru,I don't want to - I don't- I don't want to go.
fru,What am I supposed to do?
sad,You know I can't say no.
fru,The last guy who said no was fired.
fru,I put in fifteen years in this job.
fru,I'm so close.  Five more years and I retire-
fru,and we'll have that happy life.
sad,Honey after a year I can be back.
sad,They want me there two years but I could probably get
sad,maybe get some vacation-- --once it quiets down there.
sad,I know.  I know.  But they really need some good guys there.
sad,Well that's the kind of work I'm in honey.
sad,It's just going to be--it's going to go faster than you think.
sad,You tell her-- [BREATHING]
sad,What do you mean?
fru,So I have--you want me to choose between you guys or my career?
fru,What am I going to do?
fru,I want to--what am I going to do if I leave this job?
fru,Fine.  I'll see if I can talk to them.

neu,"Okay.  They can figure out pink for you.  So go in there and just tell them that and they'll hook you up with other goodies, stuff like that free service, no contract, no nothing.  Just for being a good customer"
neu,and battling through with us.
neu,Yes.  You just tell them Brent Backersen sent you.
neu,Alright?  Great.  Have a nice evening.
neu,What's he going to say?  Maybe we ought to talk to him before he sees it.
sad,Did you talk to him?
sad,He cried hard?
fru,Starting to dream about him again.  He's walking around at night again.
sad,"He's getting just like he did after he died, you know?  What, what, what's the meaning of this?"
fru,How are you going to prove it?  Can you prove it?
fru,he still thinks he's alive still.  I mean you could talk yourself blue in the face and there's no body and there's no grave so where are you?
ang,No.  It's his god damned newspapers is what it is.  Now every month there's a new boy comes home and Larry's going to be the next one.
ang,Why?
ang,"Well what do you want me to do?  I mean, you're old enough to know your own mind."
neu,"Well, I mean, you got to make sure your dad's not going--"
fru,Well I'm just saying--
fru,From your father's point of view he is still alive and if you try and take her that's just not fair.  You can't do that.
fru,"And-And-And if you go on from there if you know already to go on from there, then you can.  But I'm telling you something that I don't know where to go.  You got it?  I mean, do you?"
neu,Did you ask Annie yet?
neu,"Look, you never had seen many, many women.  You know?  I mean..."
fru,Well I just don't see why it has to be Annie.
fru,No I don't want a diagram.
fru,"He thinks he's coming back. And you go off and marry that girl and you're just pronouncing him dead and what's going to happen to him?  I don't know.  Do you?  I mean, I don't know."
ang,You're just going to leave the business?  You have a business here.  You can't do that.
sad,Tell me something.  You can leave this business?
fru,Alright but you can't talk like that you hear?
ang,"I mean what the hell have we worked for then?  I mean, it's all for you Chris.  The whole shooting match is for you."
fru,Alright but you don't talk like that you hear?  You don't.
sad,I don't understand you do I?
sad,Yeah.  I can see that.
sad,He saw it.
sad,He was out there when it happened.
sad,About four in the morning.  I heard a crack and I looked out and he was standing right there when it happened.
sad,I don't know. But after it cracked he ran back into the house and he cried in the kitchen.
sad,No.  I figured the best thing to do was leave him alone.
sad,I could hear it right through the floor.
sad,I guess he is.
sad,"I don't know.  But I know one thing mom, we made a terrible mistake with dad."
fru,Being dishonest with him.  That kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.
ang,You know that Larry's not coming back and I know that too.  Why we both go on letting him think that we both believe with him.
fru,"No I don't want to argue with him but, it's time that he realizes that nobody believes Larry's coming back anymore."
ang,"Why shouldn't he walk around and dream at him at night.  Walk around.  Why shouldn't he walk around?  Why shouldn't he dream of him, walk around at night waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say flat out that we don't have anymore hope?"
ang,That we haven't had any hope for years now?
fru,Larry's been gone for three years.  For god sakes no one comes back after three years.  It's insane.
fru,"Listen mom, just, sit down.  I want to talk to you."
fru,Alright. Alright. Alright just listen.
neu,"You know why I asked Annie here, right?"
neu,I want to ask her to marry me.
fru,You know it's not just my business.
neu,Okay.  So then it's alright.  I'll go ahead with it.
ang,Oh see then it's just not my business. God you infuriate me sometimes.  Isn't my business too if dad throws a fit?  Huh?  God you have such a talent for ignoring things.
fru,She's not Larry's girl.
fru,I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something I want I have to pull back
fru,"My whole entire, bloody life time and time again."
ang,Well to hell with that.
neu,I wanted to get this settled first.
neu,Then I guess that's the end of it.
sad,But from her letters I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.
neu,"And then we'll thrash it out with dad right?  Mom, don't avoid me."
fru,Because it is.
fru,It's just...that's just the way it is.  That's how I feel.  You know these years when I think of someone I want to marry I think of Annie.  What do you want a diagram?
fru,Alright then.
sad,I've given it three years of thought and I thought that if I waited then dad would forget about Larry and then we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.
neu,But if I can't have that here I'll get out.
neu,I'll get out.  I'll marry her somewhere else.  Maybe New York.
ang,I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker and I'm through with it.
ang,The business doesn't inspire me.
ang,Yes.  I like it an hour out of the day.  If I have to grub for money all day long at least at evening I want it beautiful.  I want a family.  I want a wife.  I want some kids.  I want to build something I can give myself to.
fru,Now Annie is in the middle of all that.  Where do I find it?
neu,Yes.  On this I would.
sad,I know.  Just you help me stay here.
sad,I am thinking like that.
sad,No you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.
ang,Why did he invite her here?
ang,Well she's been away for three and a half years in New York and suddenly she just shows up.
ang,No.  She's not his girl Joe and she knows that.
ang,"I mean, her faith is stronger than a rock."
sad,"My worst times I think about her, you know, and I"
sad,it's like I know as long as she's waiting I'm right again.
ang,"No.  Nobody in my house better dare and challenge her faith.  You know and maybe strangers but not his father, not his brother."
ang,"Laugh, laugh at me but I will.  Because you know what happened when she came here?  When she came back she slept in his room, the memorial broke into pieces. Joe, look. Look at it. You got to believe with me."
sad,"Look, it was just last week that Detroit, some boy came back he had been away longer than Larry, you can read it for yourself. You above all people have got to believe."
sad,I can't help it.
fru,Why does that bother you?
neu,"Well maybe, maybe he just wanted to see her."
fru,uh-uh What do you mean?  They grew up next to each other their entire lives.  Why shouldn't he want to see her?
fru,Hey don't look at me like that.  I don't know anymore than you.
neu,Who said he even thought about that?
neu,"Well, so what?"
fru,Now listen kid...
neu,How do you know why she's waited?  Hmmm?
fru,Look at how nice the day is.  What are we arguing for?
fru,What do you want me to do?  What do you want?
fru,But Kate...
fru,Okay. Calm yourself. Just calm yourself.
ang,"Alright, alright, calm yourself okay?  Calm yourself. Wait, wait.  What do you mean, me above all?"
ang,"Wait, what does that mean?  Me above all?"
ang,"Look at you, you're shaking."
ang,What do I got to hide?  Huh?  What the hell's the matter with you Kate?
sad,No.  I'm not sorry.  But I'm not going to stay.
sad,"Look,"
sad,"you saw the way that she acted and then well, I mean, you, you were acting kind of..."
sad,"Well, I don't know, embarrassed of her since I came."
hap,"Well,"
hap,I guess that's why I came.
hap,"Look, I've been ready for a long, long time now."
hap,"Look, I almost got married two years ago."
hap,You started to write me.
hap,Every day since.
hap,"I was waiting for you Chris, I mean, till then you never wrote and then when you did what did you say?"
hap,You'd always be so ambiguous.
hap,I'll never forgive you for that.
hap,"I mean,  Why did you wait all these years?  There I was sitting around and wondering if I was crazy for thinking about you."
hap,Not like that you're not.
sad,How many?
sad,Geez.
sad,And you still feel that way?
sad,"that includes me too, I mean and the money, you have right to that money.  Your father put planes up in the air, good planes and he deserves it, you should be proud of that.  A man should be paid for that."
hap,What am I going to do with a fortune?
neu,You're not sorry you came?
neu,What?
hap,"I mean, that's the reason why I asked you here."
hap,I love you.
hap,You felt something that far back.
hap,"Give me a kiss Ann, just give me..."
exc,"Oh God.  Annie, I kissed Annie.  I kissed Annie."
hap,We're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.
sad,"Nothing.  Hey, let's drive somewhere.  I want to be alone with you."
sad,You remember overseas I was in command of a company?
sad,Well I lost them.
sad,Just about all.
sad,Takes a little while to toss that off cause they weren't just men.
sad,"For instance, one time this...it had been raining several days and this one kid, he came up to me, he gave me his last pair of dry socks, put them in my pocket."
sad,"That's just a little thing but that's the kind of guys I had.  They didn't just die, they killed themselves for each other and I mean that exactly."
sad,A little more selfish and they'd still be here today.  And I got this idea watching them go down.  See everything was being destroyed but there was one new thing that was being created.
sad,"It was a kind of responsibility, man for man.  You understand me?"
sad,And to show that and to bring that onto the earth again like some sort of monument standing right behind all of us and we could feel it and it would make a difference to him.
sad,And then I came here and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them was a kind of bus accident.
sad,"And I went to work with dad and that rat race again and I felt what you said, ashamed.  Somehow because nobody was changed at all."
sad,"It seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive.  I felt wrong to have that new checkbook,"
sad,"open that new bank account, drive the new car and see the new refrigerator"
sad,"cause you can take those things out of the war.  But you got to know, when you drive that car that it came out of the love that a man can have for a man and you got to be a little bit better because of that."
sad,Otherwise what you have is loot and there's blood on it.
sad,And I didn't want to take any of it and I guess that included you.
hap,Annie I'm going to make a fortune for you.
hap,Buy some hats?
neu,Yes.
fru,"It's past eleven, let's go."
fru,There is no point in coming down here.
fru,That's my point.
fru,"Pass up what?  These fish swim up to shore, on the beach and then they flop around a little, they swim away and then they die."
fru,Augie.
neu,I'm just not.
fru,"You also could remember that I got sand in my panties, we got in an argument over nothing, you got a sore throat and we didn't even get to see the Grunions."
fru,You didn't see them the first time either.
exc,"Hey, what time is it?  This pokes around midnight right?  God this is great isn't it?"
exc,Look at the night we got.  I wouldn't trade this for anything.
exc,You know actually I wanted to go a little further up the coast and get away from all the lights and people but I was afraid you'd miss it.  How are you doing?
exc,"Is that, is that, nah, is that just Paul?  I can't even tell."
exc,"But if I can't tell, it probably isn't them isn't it?  Probably would be unmistakable wouldn't you think?  How are you doing?"
exc,"Oh, you know what I forgot?  I forgot my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I should've brought my flashlight."
exc,"God.  Oh, you know what would be good right about now?  A six-pack.  A six-pack would be just the ticket."
exc,"I'm so stupid, I should've brought a six-pack.  God, I'm like a little kid.  It's amazing I get out of the house with my fly zipped up. Oh- [LAUGHTER]"
exc,I wonder if they can hear us talk?  Or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?
neu,Do you want my jacket?
fru,That's my point too...No.  No.  That's not my point.  My point is what's the point if we come down here if we just turn around and leave?
exc,"Honey, this is a natural phenomenon.  It only happens once a year.  I mean think about the people in Kansas, they would have to get hotel reservations and plane tickets to come and see this.  We're only forty minutes away.  This is too good to pass up."
exc,"Well this is like the highlight, the one night of their lives and that flopping around, that's laying eggs or spawning or mating or whatever you call it."
exc,"But this is the big night for these guys.  Their last, life's last orgy."
exc,Yeah they do.
exc,"Okay.  But it's fish that do something that no other fish do.  Like the swallows in Capistrano or the Lemmings that throw themselves off the cliffs, there's magic here and some mystery and a little bit of unexplainable."
fru,"We just weren't in the good spot.  This is a much better spot.  You know, I have a good instincts for these things."
exc,"Look, is that...no is that just seaweed?"
exc,"You know, this is great isn't it?  You know, I wouldn't trade this for anything."
exc,"I mean, think about this, I know you're not interested but just think about this for a minute."
exc,"Somewhere out there, there's this huge silver mass of fish heading this way, they don't why, we don't know why, they just some little instinctual fire cracker went off in their bodies..."
exc,"...like and they all just turned at once and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming this way.  They didn't, you know, they didn't make a decision, they didn't, you know, have boats or anything.  No one sent them an invitation or a map, they just started swimming as if that's the only thing that matters."
exc,"It's single mindedness with no mind.  It's urgency that's pure urge and they don't, they don't ask it a question, they don't give it a name, they just swim."
exc,They just start swimming to this place right here where we stand for massive celebration of sex and death.
exc,"Oh, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  Look, all my hairs are standing up."
exc,[BREATHING] So what do you think?
exc,About what I just said?
fru,It certainly is not.  It's
ang,About what?
ang,It's ridiculous.
ang,"It's PR.  I mean, somebody sold you a good bill about this wonderful event that going to happen on the beach."
ang,"Yeah.  Everyone else was sold the same thing.  I mean, look, it keeps us excited, it keeps us coming back for more and you know, keeps us thinking life's going to start any minute now."
ang,"Look, I'm sorry but it's still just fish to me."
fru,"For heavens sake, grow up.  We're not going to see the Grunions."
fru,"We never do, do we?  Have we ever?"
ang,Okay.  Twice is as many times as we've tried and that's ever.
ang,"Augie, god dammit, don't ask me that.  You always ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  It's insulting."
fru,"Look, it's pointless.  It's...we're not going to see the Grunions I mean, it's like waiting around to see Santa Claus, you know, it's..."
ang,"Listen, I've waiting my entire life on this beach just standing there waiting for this fish to show up and these fish never show up."
fru,"God, you don't understand anything."
fru,"I do.  I always do.  I keep thinking, this time will be the time and it never is."
ang,"No we won't.  I mean, God, this isn't about the fish Augie."
fru,"Look, do you remember the first time we came here?"
sad,We thought I was pregnant.
sad,I'd rather not remember something...
sad,Rather not hope for something.
sad,No.
fru,No.
fru,No.
fru,No.
fru,No...No...No...
fru,No...
ang,I want things to turn out the way that they're supposed to be.
fru,"This what...what's this?  This isn't anything. Alright.  Sure.  Standing on the beach, fighting and waiting."
ang,Cause everything isn't anything like I thought it would be.
sad,This is just this.  You know?  I mean it's a lot and everything but it isn't somewhere else.  Do you know what I'm trying to say?
sad,I know you are Augie.  I know you wanted this evening to be nice.
sad,I can't help thinking about being somewhere else.
sad,I didn't say that.
sad,"Augie, whatever I'm doing I'd rather be doing with you."
sad,If anybody wants to be with anybody else it's probably you.  Probably somebody who enjoys herself a little more and is not so hard.
sad,"Well, I guess this is the wrong spot for the right people."
hap,Yeah.  I noticed that.  It's real pretty on the water.
hap,Oh you brought refreshments.
hap,No I'm beginning to think you might be right.
hap,I think this may be the place for us after all.
hap,I am sorry Augie.
hap,Or not.
exc,So what do you think?
fru,About what I just said?
fru,It certainly is not.  It's a slightly exaggerated scientific fact.
fru,I'm not the only one.  Look at all these people.
fru,Are we talking about the same thing?
fru,I thought you wanted to see it.
fru,"There's nothing to it.  The Grunions arrive, they do their little fish business, you know?  We go oh, ahh, look at the fish and they go home and we go home."
fru,Why not?
fru,"Oh my gosh.  We missed them twice, that's hardly ever."
fru,"Carla, can I ask you something?"
fru,"Don't take this wrong but, are you having your period?"
fru,What's bugging you then?
fru,I thought you wanted to see it.
fru,"No, of course not."
neu,"Well, we're going to see it."
fru,"What...I've been trying to, I've been trying to figure out the point where we went wrong and I can't seem to pinpoint that moment."
neu,"Let's see I took a shower, you were watching the news, you said hey, hey the Grunions are running tonight and I said great let's go, I feel lucky tonight."
fru,"And then I'm putting the animals out in the yard, I'm pulling the car out of the garage, putting my jacket on."
neu,Wait a minute.  I've got it.
neu,It was in the car right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker...
neu,And you said let's get some champagne and I said time's a wasting or something like that.
neu,You want this to be like the other time right?  That's it right?
fru,Do you want me to get some champagne?
fru,Take off our shoes?
fru,What?  Do you want me to breathe in your ear?
ang,Welcome to the human race.
ang,Do you think that this is what I had in mind?  That four years down the line that we'd get married and come to the beach and argue with each other over fish?  No.
ang,I was just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and everything great and the sand in our toes and the wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'd have three big fat rosy kids...
ang,...and you know?  Baby the jokes on us.  Because you know what you get?  Do you know what you get Carla?  You get this.
ang,Yes it is.
ang,Right.
fru,I'm trying to do the best I can.
sad,Maybe if you were with someone else too.
sad,I know.  But I know I don't make you happy.
hap,I mean look at the view of the moon we got from here.
hap,"Hey, look what we got here."
hap,Shh.  If we're very quiet the fish might come.
hap,Or not.
exc,Now and always sweet.
exc,"I mean, it was, it's bound to come out sooner or later."
exc,That sent shivers up my spine.
exc,Behave exquisitely.
sad,That's serious enough.
exc,I don't care then.
exc,"No, wrong number."
neu,I didn't hit you very hard.
neu,"Oh, come on, you knew there was nothing in that."
ang,Presents?  A trivial little broach.
neu,No I didn't.  You made up the whole thing in your jealous imagination.
neu,Just a little perhaps but nothing serious.
neu,"Well it didn't harm him, in fact, it pleasured him a lot and it didn't hurt me."
ang,I don't know why you want it.  You've already had two glasses.
ang,I don't see what you have to go on and on with this kind of thing.
neu,It's become a habit with you.
ang,What?
neu,"No, just making myself beautiful for you."
neu,That's the woman's job to lure the man.  Watch me a moment won't you?
ang,"Adders don't snap, they sting."
ang,They sting.
ang,Mind your business.
ang,You're quite insufferable.  I expect it's because you're drunk.
ang,You've always had a weak head.
ang,"On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk off just one glass of brandy."
ang,Shut up.
ang,"Not very funny dear.  In fact, maybe you better have some more brandy."
neu,They are away in Tunis.
fru,"Turn it on again, please."
ang,Very well.  If you insist on being a boorish and idiotic.
ang,You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.
ang,Go away.  Go away.  I hate you.
ang,"I hate you.  Listen I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully."
ang,"This is the end.  Understand?  This is the end, here and now, forever and always."
ang,"Oh, yes I am. Yes I am and you can't stop me."
ang,"Listen, you're a cruel fiend and I hate, loathe you.  Thank God finally, finally thank God I've realized just how horrible you are--and marry you?  Marry you?  Never. I will never marry you.  I will die die in torment-"
ang,Beast. Brute. Cad. Swine. Beast. Beast. Brute. Devil. Sorry.
neu,Yes.  The real cause of that rile was Peter Burden.
ang,You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.
ang,You must admit he was in love with you.
ang,You let him kiss you. You said so.  What of it?
ang,And what about me?
ang,"Oh, that's a nice point of view I must say."
ang,"Yeah, so am I.  Bored stiff."
neu,You want some brandy?
neu,I'll have a little I think.
ang,No particular reason.  Anyhow they were very small ones.
ang,Oh my...just because I just...okay...
ang,You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any yourself at the moment.
fru,Really Amanda.
fru,Nothing.
fru,Going out somewhere dear?
neu,Actually that's perfectly true.
neu,Yes it is.
neu,I think that
fru,They snap.
ang,I'm not in the least bit drunk.
ang,"Okay, like I mentioned before I had three very small, minute liquor glasses of brandy.  That's not even enough to get a child of two drunk."
ang,"Oh, what an interesting topic.  What about a child of four and a child of six?  A child of nine?"
ang,We might be able to bring up a splendid little debate about this intemperate tots.
ang,"Oh, thanks.  I think I will."
ang,You better turn that off.
ang,No I'll do no such thing.
ang,"Come on, turn it off.  It's driving me mad."
ang,Turn it--Turn it off.
ang,Very amusing indeed.
ang,"You know what?  You're a vile, little, evil-minded, little, wicked beast and I never want to see you again."
ang,You're not going nowhere. No you're not.
ang,Just shut up.
ang,shut up. shut up.  I would-I would never marry you again if you came crawling back to me on your hands and knees because you're an evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never see you again.
ang,Oh.
fru,Well I filled out all the forms and I've given them to everyone and they keep sending me to someone else.
fru,Yes.  I'm just trying to get a new license.
fru,Okay.  I did-
ang,I did exactly what they told me to do.
fru,I have done everything everyone in this entire place has told me to do.  I've been here for over an hour.  They make me wait in line.  Every single time I start over again.
fru,I have a life.  I have things to do.  I have places to go.  Can you not just put this through please?
fru,"Okay, that's nice. That's nice but I have done everything you people have told me to do. I don't understand why you can't just help me get this done.  It's simple, right?  License.  I need it. Can we just do this please?"
ang,I've been to the back of the line five times.
ang,Okay.  What is it that I did wrong on the form that I have to start all over again?
ang,"Okay.  Well, I can do that right here right now without going to the back of the line again.  See look initialed.  All done. Ready to go."
fru,I have been waiting for over an hour.
ang,I'm not starting over again.  No I have done this five times.  I am not starting over again.
fru,Look can you not just help me?
ang,I mean look she's -she's perfectly nice.  She doesn't mind waiting for a couple of minutes because I've been here all day. I have a job to get back to.  I have kids to pick up from school.  I can't just stay here.
ang,This is your job is to help people like me who need to get a new license.
ang,I'm testing your patience?
ang,I don't need to be.  I need to go and do other things with my time.  Okay.
ang,"Please just put the form in, take the picture, let me get my license and get the hell out of here.  Please."
fru,"Uh, lets- What do you need exactly?"
fru,"You need a new license, is that what you're telling me?"
fru,Let me see the form. Just let me see the form. Yeah.  You filled this out wrong.  I can't - I can't - I can't do anything with this.
fru,Ma'am I cannot help you.  You need to fill out a new form and you need to get in the back of the line.
fru,Ma'am I can't help you.  Do you understand?
ang,I've got a life too ma'am
fru,and I got to - i got to work here all day long.  Okay.  I've got to deal with you people all day.
fru,So what I need you to do is I need you to fill out this form correctly and go to the back of the line.
ang,There's nothing I can do for you.  Do you understand that?  Nothing.
fru,"What I need you to do is go to the back of the line,"
fru,fill out this form and wait
ang,You're going to have to go back again.
fru,and you filled out-
ang,Ma'am I have other people waiting in line right now.  I have other people waiting in line right now.
fru,This whole area of the form was not supposed to be filled out and you put the address in the wrong place
fru,"Uhh, and you spelled your own name wrong.  So I need you to take that"
fru,"and, uh, throw it away. I need you to fill out a new form."
fru,Ma'am you're going to have- you- look. You really- you really
ang,like I said before right now.
fru,Ma'am you are testing my patience.  Do you understand me?
ang,You're testing my goddamn patience.
ang,"I work in this fucking building all day. And I'm sick of it, okay?"
sad,Yeah.  They just called.
sad,I know.
sad,I don't know what to say.  I don't want to go but I don't have a lot of choice.
sad,I'm going to come back.  I need you to believe that.
sad,Well you have to have faith because I don't have a choice and I have to go.
sad,Do you think I want to leave you?
sad,I have to do this.  I don't want to leave.  Do you think I want to miss seeing her grow up?
fru,Look we both knew what this meant when I signed on
sad,And now- and now it's really shitty timing but now I have to go.
fru,I mean I'm the one who has to leave here.  I'm the one who has to leave the two of you.  At least you get to be together.
sad,What's that supposed to mean?
ang,Well I'll come back.  What is that supposed to mean?  You're not willing to wait for me to come back?
fru,What do you want me to do?
fru,Well I can't very well do it today.  I still have to leave tomorrow.
fru,"You're not making this any easier for me, you know.  I'm the one who has to go and you're really not helping."
fru,I do have to go. And I need to know that you're here waiting for me and that you believe that I'm coming back.
ang,Thanks that helps.
ang,I feel much better now.
fru,I know I'm leaving you here with all the responsibility but at least you get to be with her.
fru,I will but I can't right now.
ang,That's how you want to leave it?
sad,I want you to be okay with it as much as you can be.  I mean it's not a great situation but we don't have an option here.
sad,Fine.
sad,So you're leaving tomorrow.
sad,This is really-this is unfair.
fru,I don't see [BREATHING]
fru,"I mean we both knew that this was going to happen.  It's just that I feel that, you know, I don't want Susie growing up without a mother."
sad,"And, uh, I'm afraid that if you, you know, when you leave, you won't come back."
fru,You don't know that.
fru,"I'll believe it, but- I'll believe it but it- I don't know that that's going to happen."
fru,You have a choice.
fru,I know.  It's just you don't have to do this for a living you know.
fru,You're a smart person.  There are other things you can do.
sad,I mean we can't-we're not a complete family without you here.
fru,Of course I'm going to wait.  I just- I just don't like the idea of this happening because this isn't the last time this is going to happen. You're going to go on more tours and stuff.  I just- I can't-
fru,I can't deal with this emotionally.
fru,I want you to leave.  I want you to leave the service.
fru,You can do it today.  You don't have to do anything.  You don't have to do anything you don't want to do.
fru,Look I'm just telling you that you don't have to go.
ang,That's all I'm saying... No you don't.
fru,It's just really unfair.  This is- this is bullshit.
ang,"You're acting like, you know, you're the one who's going all through, you know, all this shit and it's really- it's really not."
ang,Yeah.  Of course I do because I didn't enlist in this stupid thing.  Why don't you just get out now and then-
fru,Then go.  We'll be here when you get back.
sad,"I don't know how else to leave it.  What, do you want me to lie to you?"
sad,You want me tell you that I'm okay with it?
sad,Well I can't be okay with it the same way you can't not go.  It just doesn't work that way.
exc,I have something to tell you.
exc,It's really exciting.  Don't you want to guess?
exc,Look.
exc,Yes.  He finally proposed.  I'm getting married.
exc,I know. I'm so-
exc,Thank you. [LAUGHTER]
exc,You think. [LAUGHTER]
exc,"Well actually we were just talking about today and I don't really want to do like the traditional church thing, you know.  So we are going to get married in the meadow."
exc,We're going to get married in the middle of a meadow. [LAUGHTER]
hap,"Everybody's going to come up. We're going to stay in all the pretty cabins up there and, um, everybody's going to have, you know, really flowery sort of naturey stuff."
exc,So pretty.
hap,Very Midsummer Night's wedding.
exc,Thanks. Thanks a lot.  You're really helping the Excitement here. I hope no one dies.
exc,"Okey Well- well-, you know what?  I was hoping that you would help"
exc,plan everything.  So then you can make sure that no one gets attacked by bears.
exc,Yeah?
exc,Really?
exc,"Okay.  It's going to be in, like, six months.  So we don't have a really long time."
exc,"Throw in a little- little, uh, trim in yellow.  Maybe some yellow flowers."
exc,Yes.
exc,because you're going to take care of everything.  You're going to think of all the details that I forget.
exc,Ha ha ha.
exc,Ha ha.
exc,Just couldn't be any cooler.
exc,I know.  I've been waiting forever.  I can't believe it's finally happening.
exc,You don't look like you're going to faint.
exc,So- So when are you getting married Mr. Excited?
exc,You haven't ruined it yet.
exc,You really like
exc,You could make her that excited.  You really like her.  You guys have been together for a really long time now.
exc,[LAUGHTER] That's more than I needed to know.
exc,[laughter]
neu,What?  You seem so excited.
neu,"Uh, you got a new car, a new house. Uh, a dog."
exc,Holy shit that's amazing.
exc,Congratulations.
exc,"I'm invited, right."
exc,Yeah.  I'll help plan.
neu,Why not browns?
neu,"It's a light brown, tanish."
neu,I just think browns are really what you want to go with.  I mean I think there's more contrast between brown and green than there is-
neu,I know but you just asked me to-
fru,"Come on.  Please will you do the greens and browns, just the browns for me?"
neu,Okay.  Fine.  So green and what?
neu,Blue?
neu,"Okay, fine. Greens and blues."
neu,Greens and blues and maybe a little light yellow?
neu,Yeah?
neu,"Okay.  That sounds good. Um, and, uh, we're going to get like a five, uh, story cake, right?"
neu,"I mean, you know, you're going to have at least, like, two hundred and fifty people come.  So we're going to need, you know, just a huge buffet."
neu,"Fried chicken, mashed potatoes."
neu,Well I can't be in charge of this.  I mean I got things I got to do.
exc,Well this is really exciting.  I mean- I just- I couldn't be happier right now.
exc,I'm thrilled.  God.
exc,Just ecstatic.  I can't believe you're my best friend
exc,"You're my best friend, we're growing up and now you're getting married. that's amazing"
exc,Wow.  I just- I- I- I feel like I'm going to faint.
exc,I'm so- all the blood
exc,"has just rushed to my head, and I, and I mean honestly."
exc,I'm getting a little weak in the knees.
neu,"I don't know.  Okay.  I mean gosh.  There's just- look there's a lot of pressure in getting married, okay."
neu,That's helpful.
fru,I just don't think I can do this anymore.  It's been a really long time and it's not like I'm not trying.
fru,I am try-  it's been three years
fru,and I have gone everywhere I can think of.  I have given resumes.  I have done interviews.  I've tried to pull in favors.  I've asked everybody I know for help.  I don't know what else to do.
fru,"Okay but I've been trying for three years.  Three years and I haven't gotten a bite much less actually gotten hired, and I am smart enough.  Thank you very much."
ang,I'm really good at what I do.  I just don't know how to make someone else see that.
ang,What?  Who says that?  Bananas don't grow overnight.
fru,Okay.  I think three years is a little excessive.
ang,"Yeah but you weren't unemployed for three years trying to find any job.  I mean at this point I'm going to go drive a cab or, you know, work at the gas station or something.  I don't even- I don't know what to do anymore."
fru,Nothing I'm trying seems to work. Just-
ang,Clearly everything you're doing is completely wrong.
fru,Well don't you understand that this is-
ang,I don't even- I mean you have to have some kind of an idea.  Something you could possibly throw out there that I could maybe use.
ang,I mean it's not like this is an
ang,extreme request.  I want to find a job.  Everybody wants to find a job. It's really not that.
ang,"Okay. Okay, Fine."
ang,Okey So I'm doing something wrong.  What am I doing wrong?
ang,I'm really good at what I do.  I'm smart.  I'm trained.  I have the education.  I'm talented.  I cannot-
fru,Well yeah I mean I like take a shower and stuff.
fru,[LAUGHTER] Yeah.  Usually.
fru,"Yeah, I- I make my"
fru,I make myself very presentable before I go to any kind of interview.
fru,"Uhuh. Uhuh. Yeah, yeah. Good quote."
fru,Buck-O. That's really helpful.  Just keep chugging along.  The little engine that could.
ang,Well you- just you're doing something wrong.
fru,Well maybe you could help.  I mean you've got a job.  I'm willing to look outside of my realm.  I could try something else.
fru,I'll get it.  I just need a job.  I don't care what it is.
fru,Well I mean I need to make a little bit more than the minimum wage fry flipper.
fru,I did start somewhere.  I worked my way up.  I'm not going to start at the bottom again.
ang,What's my problem?  What's my problem? I don't have a job.
ang,I thought I was pretty clear about what the problem was.
fru,Well maybe you could be a little helpful.  I mean obviously you don't have any problems so would it really take so much time out of your day to just go ahead and help somebody else.
fru,That's important.  That's really important.
neu,Well I guess you're not trying hard enough.
neu,"Just, I don't know, maybe you're not smart enough."
neu,I mean I don't know just go out and keep trying. Just-
neu,I don't know.
neu,"Hey.  Look, I mean- you know."
neu,Look bananas don't grow overnight.  Okay.
neu,You need that- Time-
neu,"You know- You need to just- you need, I mean it takes time to get a good job.  I mean-"
neu,"look at me, like, you know. I mean, Hey, I- it took me, you know, like six years to get where I am now. I mean-"
fru,I don't know.  I mean whatever.
neu,"I mean, well I mean i don't know; it doesn't really affect my life, you know."
neu,"Yeah, I understand, but-"
neu,"I don't know. Well like, I don't know. I mean-"
neu,Clearly- cle- clearly you're doing something wrong.
neu,"'Cause if you've been looking, you've been applying for jobs for three years. And-"
neu,Are you- I mean do you like get dressed up and everything when you go to the job interview?
neu,"And you like- you know, you shave your legs and everything?"
neu,"and I want- I mean you know you've got to, like, do your hair.  I mean- I don't know, it's like,"
neu,"you know what I mean? You know, it's like they say presentation is, like eighty percent."
neu,or some- some large percent of- of success.
neu,"Because I don't know I mean just, you know, just keep- keep- keep at it.  Keep trying.  Go-"
fru,"Look if I could give you a job,if I could give you a job I would but I mean I'm not in that position. I'm-"
neu,"Hey, I'd love to help you but I- you don't have the kind of training that I-"
fru,"So, go to McDonalds."
neu,Well you've got to start somewhere.  I mean-
fru,Well you're going to have to.  You don't really have an option.  What's your problem?
neu,I don't know it's like I'm trying to be-
neu,I'm trying to be helpful.
neu,I'm trying to watch TV.
fru,You guys lost my bag.
fru,Yeah.  Yeah I did.
fru,"I-I don't know.  The place where they told me to go.  Look they told me to come talk to you because you guys lost my bag.  Not it's late.  Not it will be here soon, lost it completely.  What are you going to do about that?"
fru,Look that bag has my entire life in it and you just lost it.
ang,"Lost it just, like, I mean,"
ang,it's not like it just disappeared into thin air. Somebody wasn't paying attention
ang,"because my bag was very easy to keep track of.  It's got big, you know, rainbow colored crap all over it and no one was paying attention because now it's just gone."
ang,No. No. I heard- I heard what you said.
ang,"You're kidding me, right.  You're going to give me fifty dollars to completely cover my bag, everything that was in it, the inconvenience that I've gone through.  I paid for my ticket.  All I expect is to safely get to my destination with my stuff.  Is that so much to ask?  I mean I really don't think that's that big a deal to ask you guys to have my bag in the place where I leave and then put my bag where I end up."
ang,"Yeah, well that's got everything I have in it."
ang,Look fifty dollars is unacceptable.  My bag itself cost over a hundred and fifty dollars.  You can't just give me fifty dollar gift certificate to Percoes or whatever the hell and then send me off like that's- that's good enough.  Like that's all I needed was fifty dollars.  My bag is worth more than that.
ang,I expect your airline who was responsible for my bag to give me the equivalent of the bag and all of the things in it.
ang,I didn't sign anything. I didn't sign anything. And you people have got to make-
ang,You have to make amends for what you did for losing my bag and all of my stuff.  Fifty dollars is unacceptable.
ang,No.  No.  I don't know. You know what? I'm going to call my lawyer. You know what?  That's what I'm going to do.  I'm going to call my lawyer and have him get down here and explain to you that this is an unacceptable option.
ang,I want to talk to your supervisor.
ang,"I've had enough.  I want to talk to-no, no unacceptable I want to your supervisor. I am done with this."
ang,"Really, you don't work for anybody.  It's just you?"
ang,"Okay.  Well I want to call whoever you report to, whoever your boss is because I have had enough with this airline and I am finished waiting for my fifty dollar gift certificate."
fru,Welcome to Northwest Airlines.  How can I help you?
fru,Did you file a complaint already?
fru,Where?  Did you do it at the front desk or by the baggage claims?
fru,"Ma'am, first of all I'd like you to calm down.  Second of all-"
fru,"Ma'am, I understand that."
fru,"I understand that.  The best I can do for you, at this moment, is give you fifty dollar check courtesy of Northwest Airlines for inconveniencing you in losing your luggage."
fru,"At this moment in time, all I can do for you is give you-"
fru,you're getting very excited right now
fru,"I understand that, ma'am but there's not really much I can do for you right now."
fru,What I need you to do is file another complaint form. There's a form that you can fill out over by the front desk near the baggage claim.
fru,If you'd like to take that over to the front desk- Ma'am.
fru,We're just talking over each other.
fru,We're not going to communicate anything this way.
fru,Ma'am in flying with Northwest Airlines you agreed to
fru,sign away your luggage to the
fru,"It's part of the small- it's part of the agreement when you're purchasing an airline ticket, there's- when you-"
fru,"Ma'am, please calm down.  When you purchase a ticket, there is a terms and agreement,"
fru,terms and conditions- in the agreement of purchasing a ticket. Most people frequently look it over
fru,The best that we can do for you is give you-
fru,Ma'am.
fru,I am- I am- I am my own supervisor.
fru,"I am the supervisor, ma'am."
fru,I am the current manager on duty.
fru,"Ma'am, I own Northwest Airlines."
sad,Thanks.
sad,"You know it's just, I just, you know, I mean it just happened.  I just, like- I just keep expecting him to walk in, you know."
sad,"I just- I just thought he would have longer, you know, because I'm- I mean when he found out he was sick, we knew that wasn't good but I just- I just thought that it would take longer, you know?"
sad,Yeah. I know. I know.
sad,"Yeah, I know. But I'd rather have him here with me, you know. It's just not fair.  I mean he- he didn't get to do like anything. I mean he was-"
sad,"He was only twenty four and just so many things that we were going to do, you know, and now he won't get to do them and he won't get to be here when I do.  You know, like I'll get married some day and he won't be there, like, he won't get to see that."
sad,It just doesn't seem fair.
sad,Thank you for being here.
hap,[LAUGHTER] You're probably right.  He probably would be pissed if we were all sitting around being upset about it. He'd want us to have a party.
hap,And to drink in his honor. [LAUGHTER]
sad,"Yeah, I know."
sad,"Hey, I'm, uh. I'm really sorry about what happened.  I don't um- I mean what you can you do?  I mean it's-"
sad,"When I was seven, my- my grandmother died and I really- I don't know, I mean it was really hard to let go but the important thing is- is that you do let go and your realize that, you know, they- you know, they- this person had fun while they were- while they were here and, uh, you know, you work- you work through it."
sad,Mmhmm. Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean it's- it's hard.  It's hard.
sad,Yeah.
neu,"Well I mean, you know, I mean it was I mean with that kind of condition,"
sad,"you know, it's inevitable  and I mean honestly it's- it's almost like"
neu,"you know, you don't- you know, how long do you want the person to go through that, you know."
neu,It's sort of- it's almost better off to rest in peace than he is to live in pain.
sad,Yeah.
sad,"It's not fair but I mean that's, you know, the course of life is that, you know, you meet people and you lose them."
sad,You're okay
sad,You know I think- I think we should celebrate because I think that's what he would have wanted.
neu,Yeah.
sad,"That's right.  That's right.  I mean he would want us to, you know, celebrate the life that he- that he lived and, you know, enjoy the rest of ours as much as we can."
sad,So-
exc,Guess what came today?
exc,My acceptance letter.
exc,From U.S.C..
exc,"Yes, I am."
exc,"Well yeah, that's the general idea. [LAUGHTER]"
exc,Big bad acceptance packet with all the information.  I'm going to U.S.C..
exc,I know. [LAUGHTER]
exc,"[LAUGHTER] Yeah, uh. No."
exc,[LAUGHTER] It's safe around there.
exc,The campus is beautiful. I'm so excited.
exc,"Do you want to buy me some mace for my, you know, going away present?"
exc,There we go.  Perfect.
exc,And a taser.  Excellent.  Just make sure it's a big knife.
exc,I don't want any of those little puny ones.
exc,Well I was thinking maybe underwater basket weaving.
exc,"U.S.C. has a major in that, right."
exc,They have - U.S.C. has everything because U.S.C. is the best school ever.
exc,Okay.  Well I'm lying but-
exc,"Well, I haven't decided yet.  I want to try some things out."
exc,okay.  Well I'm not going to be undecided forever. [LAUGHTER]
exc,And it's so close so you can come visit me all the time.
exc,"So this works out perfectly.  Because I was worried if I didn't get in to U.S.C., then I would have to go somewhere far away and then-"
exc,Everything worked out perfectly.
exc,I know.  We should have a party.
exc,An I got accepted to U.S.C. party.
exc,No.  An I got accepted to U.S.C. party. [LAUGHTER]
exc,Right.  Now you're with me.
exc,That is why I got accepted.
exc,I know.
exc,What- what did you have in mind?
exc,[LAUGHTER]
exc,On occasion I've heard of it.
exc,Yeah.  Totally.
exc,I am totally down with the ice cream.
exc,"Eh, we can work that part out."
exc,Alright.
exc,party.
exc,I know.
exc,Okay well that's not a happy part.  We don't want to talk about that.
exc,"Well no.  I mean I have some scholarships and some financial aid and stuff but I'll have to, you know, I'll get a job"
exc,while I'm in school.  It'll be good.
exc,Yeah.  It will work out.  Maybe I could work at Red Lobster.
exc,I know.  Right down the street.
exc,Excellent.  Drive drunk people around because you know that's all campus cruisers for.
exc,"Okay.  No, that's dorky."
exc,Yeah.
exc,Student counsel?
exc,"No, it's dorky."
exc,Social life.  Hello.
exc,[LAUGHTER].
exc,[LAUGHTER].
exc,"No.  But I'm thinking I might, you know, like audition for a play or something.  I don't really want to do the sorority thing.  I'm not really feeling that vibe with the"
exc,What have you heard about the Greek system?
exc,"Oh, oh, I'm sorry, my bad.  I'll have to, like, sign up for summer lessons from you before I go.  You can teach me how to be cool before I go to college."
exc,That's what you're saying. I'm right. [LAUGHTER]
exc,me.
neu,"Hey, what's up?"
exc,What?
exc,That's awesome.  Congratulations.
exc,That's amazing.  Wow.
neu,I know but you should get like a taser or something.  I mean walking around the campus at night-
neu,"So, um- so what are you going to- what are you going to major in?"
neu,they have that as a major?
neu,That's ridiculous.  I don't believe that.
neu,"Seriously, what's your major?"
neu,So you're undecided?
neu,"Hey, that's cool."
neu,"No, no.  It's totally cool.  I mean, like, this friend of mine he was- he's been undecided now for, like, the past like eleven years of his life."
neu,"Uh, well-"
neu,You- you- you'll find.
neu,"You'd have to, like go somewhere else, and, you know, we would be apart, and that would suck."
exc,That's awesome.
neu,"Oh, that's right. Okay, I see. Right, right, right."
neu,A party celebrating your acceptance.
neu,That's cool.
exc,"Well, that's really cool that you're going to be staying in the same city and everything. so umm"
neu,"I don't know are you, like, I don't know.  Are you, like, available or anything?"
exc,"Well I mean I don't know.  It's like you know I kind of had a crush on you throughout high school and, like"
exc,"I don't know I just thought that, you know, maybe we could, you know, I don't know.  It's like, you know, just test the waters anyway.  I don't see what the problem is."
exc,"Movies- movie, we'll go to a movie and a dinner and- and"
exc,"actually, you know, there's this- there's this really cool restaurant, um, I don't know if you-  it's Red Lobster.  It's like down on"
exc,Vermont.
exc,"Wait, you've been there before?"
exc,"Oh, so well then you know that it's awesome."
exc,"Right, so we'll go there and then- and then we'll get some ice cream and maybe we'll go putt-putt golfing."
neu,Okay.  Putt-putt golfing?
exc,"Yeah, you want to go.  No, you want to go. You want to go."
exc,I can see it in your eyes.  You want to go.
exc,Good. Alright we're so happy.
exc,"That's right.  Um, so U.S.C. is a really nice school."
neu,Are you going to take out loans or-
neu,"But, um-"
neu,"I mean, like, I don't know.  I'm just saying if you need to make some extra cash.  You can, you know"
neu,Or library.
neu,I just said the library
neu,"or, um, campus cruiser.  You can drive people around."
neu,Right or you can run for student counsel.
neu,Dorky?
neu,It's important.
neu,Fine.  It's dorky.
neu,But that'll fit you  because you're a dork.
exc,I dork.
neu,"Yeah, you don't want to do the sorority thing because you'll probably get used and abused by"
neu,lots of drunk frat boys
neu,Yeah.
neu,"I mean it's not really free because you have to pay for it, but yeah."
neu,Well do you think you're going to live on campus or off campus your first year?
neu,"I hate to break this to you but you meet people by being cool, so-"
neu,"No, no, no.  You're right though.  I mean, you know, dorms are definitely the way to meet people.  I know that I was in an apartment off campus"
neu,"that happened, you know, that was going on."
hap,Hello.  Thank you for calling Dell Taco Corporate.  Can I help you?
neu,"Okay.  Well, Did you go through the automated menu?  Most of your requests can be taken care of through that."
neu,Okay.  Well I'd be happy to-
fru,"Okay, sir.  I'd be happy to help you."
neu,"Sir, can- can you tell me which branch you went to.  We can start there."
neu,"Okay.  Um, and what was the complaint?"
neu,"Can you be a little more specific, sir?"
fru,"Did you try to take them back and get your order fixed, sir?"
neu,"Well I'm very sorry, sir.  They should have dealt with it at that particular branch.  I apologize for that, uh, but we can help you.  That's no worries.  We can take care of that.  So how much did you need to be refunded?"
neu,"Okay.  Um, I'm going to go ahead and transfer you over to another department.  They'll need your address."
fru,"I understand, sir.  I will explain to them what the situa-"
fru,"Okay, sir.  They- they have to-"
fru,Sir.
fru,"Sir, they have to take down your address at the other station.  I will transfer.  I will explain everything to them.  It will all be fine.  I promise."
fru,Cindy?
fru,"Sir, I don't think my name is really relevant-"
fru,"Alright, sir. Sir.  I'm going to transfer you to the address."
fru,"Alright.  You know what, sir.  The customer is always right."
fru,I will go ahead and I will take- I will take
ang,But I'm giving you what you want.
fru,"Okay.  If that's what you want, you want to go to the next person?"
fru,Okay.  Great.
fru,"Yeah, um.  I have been trying to reach somebody who will refund, uh, my money."
neu,"Um, I basically, um I- I ordered some food"
fru,um and everything was pretty much uh- uh- just not done right. All the orders were messed up.
fru,"Yes, I did and that didn't- I got through to, like, one operator and she sent me to like three others"
fru,"If you could just give me that, then I will leave you alone. And just- if i could also- What?"
fru,The food was prepared incorrectly.
fru,I asked for no tomatoes.
neu,"It was a hundred a sixty dollars.  I'm sorry, uh, sixteen dollars."
ang,"Look, I don't want to be transferred over to another- All I want to do is just give you my name and address so you can send me a check."
ang,"Okay.  You understand that's all I want. Just don't give me a problem with this.  Okay, please because I'm very sensitive right now"
ang,"and if I get sent to another operator, I'll have to tell them the same damn story again.  I don't- I think I'm just going to lose my mind.  So if you could please just not do that, that would be great.  Thank you."
ang,You don't understand because you've never gone to Del Taco and gotten the service that I've gotten.  You don't understand.
ang,You're not going to call the other operator. You're not going to call the the other operator.
ang,You're going to fill out a form on your desk
ang,because I know you're at a desk right now in your stupid corporate building and you're going to send me a check for sixteen dollars and forty two cents.
fru,What's your name?
ang,Cindy?  Cindy what?
ang,"Cindy, look.  If you don't get your ass a piece of paper that has a check"
ang,"attached to it and you don't send it to me, I'm going to get very upset."
fru,"You know what.  I- You know what? You know what? No, it's fine. it's fine it's fine You know what?"
fru,"Hey, Cindy. Cindy, look I know this is not your fault.  Do whatever you want."
fru,Send me to whatever operator. I just- You know what?  I'm just done.  I'm just done.  I've lost all hope.
fru,"of getting my sixteen dollars back. It fine, no honestly."
fru,"No, Cindy just don't even-look don't even.  Cuz I- look Cindy I know you don't care about me, okay.  I know that I'm just like another person who calls-"
fru,No it doesn't matter.  It's fine.  It's fine.  Just send me to the next operator.  That's fine.
sad,Did you talk to him?
fru,What was he doing out here at that hour?  He's dreaming about him again.  He's walking around at night.
ang,"What do you want to do, argue with him?"
ang,You can't say that to him.
ang,How are you going to prove it?  Can you prove it?
ang,To you it is and to me but not to him.  You can talk yourself blue in the face but there's no body and no grave so where are you?
ang,The trouble is the goddamn newspapers.  Every month some boy turns up from nowhere so the next one is going to be Larry.
neu,"Well that's only your business, Chris."
ang,What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.
fru,I'm just saying.
ang,I ignore what I got to ignore. The girl is Larry's girl.
ang,"From father's point of view, he's not dead and you have no right to take his girl."
ang,"Now you can go on from there and you know where to go, but I'm telling you I don't know where to go.  See I don't know.  Now what can I do for you?"
neu,You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong in that.
fru,How do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way father does.
fru,The trouble is you don't see enough women.  You never did.
ang,I don't see why it has to be Annie.
ang,Well that's a good answer but it don't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you went to war.  It's been five years.
fru,"I don't want a diagram.  He thinks he's coming back, Chris."
ang,You marry that girl.  You're pronouncing him dead.  Now what happens to your father?  Do you know because I don't?
ang,Are you crazy?
ang,You've got a business here.  What the hell is this?
ang,Must you be inspired?
fru,You mean-tell me something you mean you'd really leave the business?
ang,Alright but don't think that way
ang,"because what the hell did we work for?  This whole shooting match is just for you, Chris."
ang,But don't think that way.  You hear me?
ang,Yeah.  I can see that.
neu,He saw it.
sad,"No, I figured the best thing was to leave him alone."
sad,I could hear him right through the floor of my room.
fru,"I don't know the meaning of this, mom.  But I know one thing you made a terrible mistake with dad."
fru,"Being dishonest with him, that kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off."
ang,You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?
ang,I don't want to argue with him but it's time that he realizes that Larry's not coming back anymore.
ang,We've got to say it to him.
ang,For God's sake three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane.
fru,Sit down mom.  I want to talk to you.
fru,"Alright, alright, alright.  Listen. You know why I asked Annie here don't you?"
neu,You know why.
neu,I'm going to ask her to marry me.
fru,You know it's not only my business.
fru,Then it's alright.  I'll go ahead with it.
ang,Then it isn't just my business.
ang,Sometimes you infuriate me.  You know that?  Isn't it your business too if I tell this to father and he throws a fit about it.
ang,Sometimes you have a- Sometimes you have a talent for ignoring things.
fru,She's not Larry's girl.
fru,"I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer. My whole bloody life time after time after time."
ang,To hell with that.
sad,I wanted to get this settled first.
fru,"Well if she does, then that's the end of it.  From her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out."
ang,"and then we'll thrash it out with dad, right mom.  Don't avoid me."
ang,So what I'm not fast with women.
ang,Because it is.
sad,"These years when I think of someone for my wife, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?"
ang,"I've given it three years of thought.  I hoped that if I waited, dad would forget about Larry"
fru,"and everything would be happy and we would have a regular wedding.  But if that can't happen here, then I'll have to get out."
ang,"The business, the business doesn't inspire me."
fru,"Yes, I like it an hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, at least at evening I want it beautiful."
fru,I want- I want a family.  I want some kids.  I want to build something I give myself to.  Annie is in the middle of that.  Now where do I find it?
fru,Then you help me stay here.
fru,I know.  Just you help me stay here.
ang,Why did he invite her?
ang,It's been three years.  Why all of a sudden?
fru,Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.
ang,"What's going on here, Joe?"
ang,"No, line."
ang,"She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not."
ang,Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men.  Why hasn't she married?
ang,Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish but she's waited.
ang,Because she knows what I know that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.
fru,"In my worst moments, I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right."
fru,"Nobody in this house dares take her faith away, Joe.  Strangers might but not his father, not his brother."
fru,"Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself."
ang,"She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look, look at it.  Joe-"
fru,"Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand alone."
fru,Just last week a man showed up in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  You read it yourself.
fru,You above all have got to believe.  You.
fru,Just don't stop believing.
fru,I can't help it.
neu,Why does that bother you?
neu,Well maybe- maybe he just wanted to see her again.
neu,How do you know he's even thinking about it?
fru,Listen kid.
neu,"Uh, Then why is she still-she's not his girl, Joe"
neu,You can't read her mind.
fru,How do you know why she waited?
fru,Look it's a nice day.  What are we arguing for?
fru,What do you want me to do?
fru,But Kate-
fru,Calm yourself.
fru,Calm yourself.
fru,Alright.  Alright.  Calm yourself.
fru,Why me above all?
ang,"What does that mean, me above all?  Look at you.  You're shaking."
fru,What have I got to hide?  What the hell is matter with you Kate?
hap,I guess this is why I came.
hap,"Chris, I've been ready a long, long time."
hap,You started to write me.
hap,Every day since.
hap,"I was waiting for you, Chris.  Till then you never wrote and then when you did what did you say.  I mean you sure can be ambiguous you know."
hap,I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I've done is sit and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.
neu,"Yeah, sure."
sad,How many?
hap,What'll I do with a fortune?
ang,What?
neu,I guess you know this is why I asked you to come.
hap,"Ann, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you."
hap,I have no imagination that's all I know to tell you.
hap,I'm embarrassing you.  I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I
neu,And he's gone forever.  You're sure?
hap,"Give me a kiss, Ann.  Give me a-God I kissed you."
hap,"I kissed Annie.  How long, how long I've been waiting to kiss you."
hap,"Annie, we're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy."
sad,"No, nothing like that."
sad,Yes.  I suppose I have been but it's going from me.
fru,I don't know where to start.
sad,There's so many things mixed up.
sad,You remember overseas I was in command of a company?
sad,Well I lost them.
sad,Just about all.
sad,It takes a lot of time to toss that off because they weren't just men.
sad,"For instance, one time it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks."
sad,I put them in my pocket. that's only a little thing but these are the kind of guys I had.
sad,They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.
sad,"And I got this idea watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed see, but it seemed to me that there was one new thing that was made"
sad,a sort of responsibility man for man.  You understand me?
sad,And then I came home and it was amazing.
sad,"I felt, what you said, ashamed somehow"
sad,because nobody was changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.
sad,"I felt wrong to be alive, to open the new bank book, to drive the new car, to see the new refrigerator."
sad,"when you drive the new car, you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've got to be a little better because of that."
sad,Otherwise what you have is really just loot and there's blood on it.  I didn't want to take any of it.
sad,I guess that included you.
hap,"Annie, Annie I'm going to make a fortune for you."
neu,Fine.
fru,It's not yours.
ang,It's after eleven let's go home.
ang,There is no point in coming down here.
fru,That's my point.
fru,So let's go home.
fru,Not particularly.
ang,I just don't.  It's stupid.
ang,"Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, flop around, and then swim away and then they die."
ang,What are you so excited about?  This isn't a moon landing we're talking about.  It's fish.  It's fish nobody even eats.
fru,"Oh, Augie."
ang,I'm just not.
ang,Yes.
ang,We didn't see them the first time either.
fru,That's the wind.
ang,About what?
ang,It's ridiculous.
hap,What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.  This is great isn't it?  Look at this night we've got here.  It couldn't be better.
exc,"Is that, is that-that's just foam isn't it?  I can't even tell"
fru,"Oh, no you know what I did?  I forgot my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid I forgot my flashlight."
fru,"The flashlight, the silver one.  There's only one isn't there?"
fru,Well sure.
fru,"No of course our flashlight, yours and mine, mi flashlight es su flashlight naturally.  How could we not think to bring it?"
exc,I hope the moon stays out.  I wonder do they always run during a full moon.  I can't remember if it was full last year.  Remember?
neu,"Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket."
hap,"Ah, this is great, isn't it?  I didn't even think to bring a six-pack.  A six-pack would be just the ticket right about now."
fru,Are you kidding?  We'd miss it.  We just got here.  What's the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home?
fru,Right.
neu,That's my point too.
fru,"No, no, no.  That's not my point.  My point is is that there's no point in coming down here if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it?"
fru,Honey this is natural phenomenon.  I mean this only happens once a year.  This is a great opportunity.
exc,Think about the people in Kansas.  They'd have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up.
fru,"Yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping around is laying eggs or what do you, spawning or mating something like that."
exc,This is the big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy.
fru,"Yeah, they do."
fru,Okay but it's fish who do something none of the other fish do
exc,"like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs, like that.  There's mystery here and magic"
fru,a little bit of the unexplainable.  I don't see how you cannot be interested.
fru,I don't get it.  The first time we came here to see it you said it was the best night of your life and last year I remember distinctly you were so excited to get here.  You stubbed your toe rushing me out the door and didn't even notice until we were in the car.
fru,We weren't in a good spot.
ang,We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.
exc,"I've got good instincts for these things.  Look there. What's that.  Is that?  Is that, is that-no it's just seaweed isn't it."
exc,"Ah, man this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  I mean think about this.  I know you're not interested but just think about this for a minute."
exc,Out there someplace there's this huge mass of silver fish heading this way.  They don't know why.  We don't know why.  It wasn't a decision.  They didn't take a vote.
exc,No one sent them a map or an invitation.  Just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one. They turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.
exc,They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.
exc,It's single mindedness with no mind.  Urgency that's pure urge.
exc,They don't know what drives them.  They don't give it a name or ask question.  They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them here to this place
exc,where we stand for massive celebration of sex and death.
exc,"Ah, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  All my hairs are popping up."
ang,It's PR.  Somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to take place on the beach.
ang,Goddamn it Augie don't ask me that.  You always ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  It's insulting.
ang,We just have different ideas about what this evening is supposed to look like.
ang,"For heaven's sake, this is not about fish."
neu,We totally skipped. Right.
ang,"For heaven's sake, grow up we are not going to see the Grunions."
ang,We never do.  Do we have we ever?
ang,Twice is every time we've tried that's ever.
ang,and the fish won't show up.
fru,You don't understand anything I'm saying.
fru,I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking that this time will be the time but it never is.
sad,We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  So we took off our shoes
sad,"and you popped the cork and while we were dancing, you said the softest most intimate things to me"
sad,right into my ear so that I could hear them as much as- so that I could feel them as much as hear them.
sad,"And I remember thinking this is it.  At last, at last I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be."
sad,"Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne from the bottle."
sad,I would rather not remember some things.  I would rather not hope for some things.
neu,No.
sad,No.
fru,No.  No.
fru,No.
fru,No.
fru,No.
ang,No.
ang,"This what, what is this?  This isn't even anything."
ang,"Oh, right, sure this is standing on the beach.  This is waiting.  This is fighting."
sad,"I know you are, Augie.  Really I do.  I know you wanted this to be special and nice and it's the full moon and the sand and all but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else."
fru,I didn't say that.
fru,"For heaven's sake, whatever I'm doing I'd rather be doing it with you."
fru,Well don't be ridiculous.  Don't you know that?  You're the one who probably wishes you were with somebody else
sad,somebody who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard.
hap,"Yeah, I noticed that.  Looks pretty on the water doesn't it, big old white moon."
hap,"Oh, Augie you brought refreshments."
hap,Well then I guess we don't need glasses.
hap,I'm beginning to think you might be right.  I think this may be the spot after all.  Augie I'm sorry.
neu,"Well, so what do you think?"
fru,Well then what's bugging you?
fru,"There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunions arrive.  They do their little fish business.  We go oh, ah look at the fish.  They go home.  We go home."
fru,Why not?
fru,Why not?
fru,We've missed them twice that's not ever.
fru,We'll see them this year.
fru,I thought you wanted to see it.
fru,"No, of course not."
fru,It's just a fish.  Nothing to get traumatized over.
fru,I've been trying to work this backwards but I can't seem to pinpoint the moment when we took a turn for the worse.  You were fine during the phone call from Marge.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem.
neu,Wait a minute.  I've got it.
neu,"It was in the car right.  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said let's get some champagne and I said times a wasting or something like that.  Right?"
exc,"That's it, right?  You want this to be like the other time, right.  That's it."
neu,You want me to get some champagne?
fru,Well what?  Want me to breath in your ear?
fru,Want to get married again?
fru,What?  What do you want a divorce?
fru,A vacation?
fru,"A new carpet, a poodle, a backrub, ice cream, a suicide pact.  What?  What?  Carla what the hell do you want?"
fru,"Do you think that when I proposed, I had this great fantasy going that four years down the line we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish."
fru,Do you think that I knew that there'd be times when you'd look at me like I'm a used Kleenex and times I would look at you and think holy hell when's the next flight to Alaska.
fru,"No, no I'm just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and sand in our hair and wind in our"
fru,"Sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will always pay themselves and ha, ha baby the jokes on us.  Because you know what you get,"
fru,I'm doing the best I can.
sad,Maybe if you were with somebody else too.
sad,"No, I know but still.  I know I don't make you happy."
neu,"Actually now that you mention it, no I don't."
neu,I don't know.  It seemed like a good spot to me.
exc,Well look at what we got here.
neu,It's not champagne.
exc,Ahh.  It sent shivers up my spine.
exc,Behave exquisitely.
exc,Certainly I shall probably do a court curtsy.
exc,It's true the whole business is very poor joke.
exc,Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious.
neu,Who's they?
exc,"Oh, how long will it last, this ludicrous, over-bearing love of ours?"
neu,What happens if one of us dies?  Does the one that's left still laugh?
exc,"Thank you, dear.  The same applies to you except that if I catch you so much as looking at another woman, I'll kill you."
exc,Which particular one?
exc,"Oh, Charles.  That was his name.  Charles he did wriggle so beautifully."
exc,"Yes, I know you did.  You threw him out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that."
exc,It burnt my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.
exc,Then the manager came in and found us rolling about on the floor biting and scratching like panthers.
exc,"How ridiculous.  How utterly, utterly ridiculous."
exc,And very much sillier.
exc,What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us?
exc,With the most perfect poise.
exc,"Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy, do they?"
neu,"Don't say that, my darling."
neu,Well who knows?
neu,Do you remember that awful scene in Venice?
neu,The one where you bought that little painted wooden snake and put it on my bed.
neu,Horrible thing.  I hated it.
neu,How long did that row last?
neu,The worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt holes in my dressing gown.
ang,What of it?
fru,"Oh, dear.  I'm bored with this conversation."
fru,No thanks.
ang,It's become a habit with you.
ang,"Oh, don't be so stupid."
ang,What?
fru,Just making myself fascinating for you.
fru,The woman's job is to allure the man.  Watch me a minute will you.
fru,"Oh, no it isn't"
ang,It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.
ang,Adders don't snap they sting.
ang,They sting.
ang,"I don't care, okay.  Do you understand?  I don't care.  I don't mind if they bark and roll about like hoops."
ang,"Yes, I did quite a lot."
ang,Mind your own business.
ang,You're quite insufferable.  I expect it's because you're drunk.
ang,You always had a weak head.
ang,"On, the contrary.  A child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy."
ang,"Oh, shut up."
ang,"Not very funny, dear.  You'd better have some more brandy."
ang,Why?
ang,There is no one upstairs.  It's a photographer's studio.
ang,Very well if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.
ang,You're far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.
ang,"Go away, go away.  I hate you."
ang,Listen? Listen indeed.  I'm sick and tired of listening to you.  You damn sadistic bully.
ang,Stop.
ang,"Stop, stop.  I hate you.  Do you hear?  You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible."
ang,"This is the end do you understand?  The end,"
ang,finally and forever
ang,"Oh, I am.  Let go of me."
ang,"Oh, I hate you. It's a good thing that I found out in time what you're really like. Marry you again?  Never, never, never."
ang,I'd rather die in torment. Beast.  Brute.  Calf swine.
neu,"As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden."
ang,I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.
ang,You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.
ang,You let him kiss you.  You said you did.
ang,What of it?
ang,What about me?
ang,"That's a nice point of view, I must say."
neu,"I'll have some myself, I think."
fru,You can hardly call three liquor glasses in the whole evening going on and on and on.
ang,"Really, Amanda."
ang,Nothing.
ang,"Going somewhere, my dear?"
fru,"Snap, snap, snap like a little adder."
neu,Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?
ang,I'm not in the least drunk.
fru,I think I mentioned once before that I had three minute liquor glasses of brandy the whole evening long.  A child of two couldn't get drunk on that.
ang,Very good idea.  I will.
ang,There are people downstairs I suppose.
ang,This is no time of year for Tunis.
ang,Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.
ang,"Amanda, listen."
ang,Very amusing.
ang,"You're a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast. And I hope I never see you again as long as I live."
ang,You're not going like this.
ang,You're not.
ang,Shut up.  Shut up. I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on your bended knees.
ang,"You're a mean, evil minded, little tempered witch. I hope to God I never set eyes on you again as long as I live. Whore."
neu,Okay.  What's the problem?
neu,"Okay, um.  Do you have your photo ID with you?"
neu,Okay.  This is the wrong form.  I'm sorry.
fru,"I don't have the form.  You're going to have to go get in that line over there and they will give you the right form.  And after you fill it out, you can bring it back to me."
fru,I don't have any of
fru,I don't have any of them over here.  You're gonna have to go get in that line over there.  And they will give you a copy of the form.
fru,"Nope, I don't. I don't have-"
fru,"No, I can't. That's-"
fru,I'm sorry.  You have to do things the way you have to do things here.  We have rules.
fru,"Go get in that-- Sir-- Sir, there are people in line behind you. you need"
fru,"I'm sorry.  I'm sorry you're having a hard time,"
fru,but you're gonna have to go get in  that line to
neu,twenty bucks? Please. Go get in that line over there.
fru,"Look, I'm having a really bad day.  I'm off in twenty minutes and I just really don't need this right now, okay."
fru,"And you're gonna have to go wait again, because that's the line you need."
fru,I can't do that. It's against our rules. You can go get in that line over there or you can just go ahead and leave and come back another day.  Maybe there will be a shorter line.
fru,I can't do that.
fru,"I'm sorry, but I can't do that."
ang,So go get in the other line or leave.  Or I will have you escorted out by security.
ang,Would you like to be kicked out of the D.M.V.?  You don't think that'll be a little embarrassing?
fru,The one you just came from.
ang,Yeah.  Thank you.  Have a pleasant day.
neu,"Yeah, hi.  Um, look, I -- all I'm trying to do right now is renew my license plate.  That's all.  I just need to get one of those little stickers."
fru,"And I've- I've- some lady -- I got in line.  I waited for about two hours um, and, I gave her this form"
fru,"that she gave to me earlier. And she said oh, I gave you the wrong one by accident.  So I was hoping I could just fill out a new one, give it to you and sort of skip this whole line business."
neu,"Yes, I do."
fru,"This is -- okay, then just can I have the form that I need."
fru,Don't you -- you don't have-
fru,are you telling me you don't have a stack of them behind the desk?
fru,"But you're -- it's the same -- I mean, you can -- like I can't go behind your desk--"
fru,or I can't go behind there- you can go behind this person's desk and just grab the form. So if you could just do that; that would help me out a lot.
fru,"Look, can you please just-- --make this -- look, I look--"
fru,look-- It's  been- it's been two hours.  Can you please just make this easier on me and just go and get the form?  It's not- it's really not
fru,What if I pay you money?
fru,"Can I pay you money?  Can I give you, like, twenty bucks and you'll go back there and get the form?"
fru,"Come on.  Will you please?  I just --I look, I  cannot-- --just if I --"
fru,"I don't care, well- You're having a bad -- I just waited in line for two hours."
fru,That's all I- I just- That's all i want you to-
fru,"Rules, you just have to grab a piece of paper behind from somebody's desk"
ang,It's not rocket science.
fru,"Come -- just, please, just grab the form.  It's right over there."
fru,Why are you being such a bitch?
fru,"Please, will you please -- will you please just grab the form?"
fru,"Fine, which line is it?"
ang,"Okay, fine.  I'll go over there.  Thanks, a lot.  You've been really helpful."
fru,You're just going to pick up and leave me and our baby and miss a year of our lives?
fru,"Do you want to -- do you want to leave us behind?  I mean, I don't understand why you have to do this."
fru,Can't you ask them?  Can't you go back and ask them if you could -- I don't know if you could change  assignments or something and you could stay here?
fru,"Why not?  You could, at least, try.  They have to understand"
sad,You won't even know your child when you come back.  This -- isn't there someone you could talk to?
fru,Explain the situation to them and then you can stay here.
fru,"And what happens if, at the end of that year, they ask you to stay longer?  Are you just going to agree?  Are you just going to absentmindedly brainwashedly do whatever it is they tell you to do?"
fru,Then why do you have to go a year at all?
fru,Well unagree.  Tell them that you can't leave right now.  I can't do this by myself.  I can't do this without you.
fru,"There has to be something.  I mean, we can't just live with this.  It's not -- it just won't work this way."
fru,Just tell them no.
fru,"Then, can't you please try something?  If you go and ask them and they say no, then I would understand, but you're not even willing to ask."
fru,Can't you just make an effort?  Can't you just try?
sad,When do you leave?
ang,A week.  You're giving me a week to be okay with this.
fru,Well it doesn't seem like you're that bothered by it.
fru,"If you really cared so much, you'd find a way out."
fru,"It's a free world.  I can go where I want.  Wherever you are, that's where we're going to go."
fru,"I'm finding a way to make it work.  And I will go wherever you go.  Whatever I have to do, I will make this work."
fru,You're not really giving me a lot of options.
fru,But I'm supposed to be okay with you going there.
sad,It's only going to be a year.
fru,There's nothing I --
fru,"It's -- look, it's only a year.  It'll go by quickly.  Okay."
fru,"I know, but I'll be back then.  And - and- and we'll have -- we have the rest of our lives."
fru,I can't do that.  I have to go.
fru,I've made a pledge.  I can't not do this at this point.
fru,I know that. I know that. I know that.
neu,"There's nothing I can do.  I mean, I have to go."
fru,"And this is what I do.  This is -- I mean, this is my life.  And I know that you're part of my life, too, and I mean, it's only -- it's just going to be a year.  I'll be back."
fru,It's not- it's not- It's not like that.  It's not like that.  I can't do that.
fru,Because it's impossible.  There's -- I just can't.  I can't.
fru,"Look, honey, it's- it's- it's only going to be a year."
fru,It's only going to be a year. I'm not going to miss my son's entire life.
fru,I'm not going to stay more than a year.  I've  agreed to a year
fru,Because I've already agreed to that.
fru,"Yes, you can.  Yes, you can.  You know you can.  You're a strong person."
fru,It is. It is. It is. It is. I'm going to write you every day.
fru,What else can we do?  I -- we don't have a choice in this.  Do you understand?  You can't come with me and I can't stay here.  That's all there is to it.
fru,We don't have a choice.  I have to do this.
fru,"I can't do it.  I'd love to.  I mean, I don't - if you understand, I don't want to stay."
fru,"I mean, I don't want to -- I don't want to leave.  I want to stay here with you."
fru,I've asked already.  I can't go back.
fru,"It can't happen.  I have to go.  I want to stay really bad, but I can't.  There's just no -- I don't have an option."
fru,Next week.
fru,"You can't make it out like I'm happy about this.  I mean, I didn't -- I didn't want to put you in this situation."
fru,"I am.  I mean, I don't know.  I don't know what else to tell -- you know, I mean, I can tell you.  I don't know what else to do. I mean, I've been forced into this situation."
fru,There's nothing I can do.  I-- I
fru,They won't let you come along.  It's not going to happen.
fru,Are you kidding? Please don't be difficult about this.
fru,[BREATHING]
fru,"Look, I--"
fru,Where I'm going is not the safest place on the earth.  Okay.
fru,But I've been trained.  You have no training.
fru,You have to.  Do you understand me?  You have to.
fru,"Well I guess we're at a stalemate then, aren't we?"
exc,I can't -- how did you do it?  What happened?
exc,[LAUGHTER] Well you paint a romantic picture.
exc,Did she cry?
exc,"Oh, my God.  How long have you been planning on doing this?"
exc,I can't believe this.  You're getting married. It's crazy!
exc,"Yeah, it is."
exc,"Yeah, I would love to. Thanks. [LAUGHTER]"
exc,"Oh, my God, where -- have you guys talked about where you're going to get married or--"
exc,"Oh, my God."
exc,Are you going to get married like on the beach barefoot or like fancier?  Like in a church.
exc,Well I don't know.  Throwing it out there.
exc,It's so exciting.  What's the ring look like?
exc,Big and shiny.  You're such a guy. [LAUGHTER]
exc,I'm so excited for you. That's great. I'm so-
exc,It's fantastic.  I -- congratulations. It's amazing.
hap,This is why men don't plan weddings. [LAUGHTER]
exc,All fruit and brown. [LAUGHTER]
exc,"Yeah, it's pretty amazing, huh?"
hap,"Well I didn't want it to be like cheesy, you know."
hap,"She didn't cry, but she was laughing a lot and it was very exciting, so..."
hap,"Honestly, it was kind of quickly.  It was actually only in the past couple months."
hap,"Yeah. Yeah. So- I know.  I know. I know.  It's weird 'cause it's like the beginning of the rest of my life, you know."
hap,"But uh- no, I mean, you know.  You know, I really want you to like, you know, sort of"
exc,Okay. Well there you go.
exc,Barefoot?
exc,Yeah.  But I'm really excited.  So and everybody's going to come out and it'll be a great time.  And--
exc,It's big and shiny.  I don't know.  It's silver and--
hap,"Yeah, I don't know. [LAUGHTER] But, yeah, so anyway -- well I wanted to tell you that, you know, 'cause you're one of my good friends and you're Kate's- one of her best friends and-"
hap,"Yeah, yeah. She was actually -- she was going to tell you but I told her that I wanted to tell you and she had to work today anyway, so I decided to-"
hap,"Yeah, yeah."
exc,"Thank you.  I'm really -- I'm really excited.  And it's -- I don't know, it's like a little -- it's like a little scary, 'cause I'm like, ah, you know, it's the first time I've ever done anything like this."
hap,"But, you know, it's like I really love her and I really just -- I can't imagine spending my life with anybody else but her.  So, you know, it's like I know that's the right thing.  And if you have to, you know, if you have to question that, you know, don't- don't do it.  So we're going to do it."
hap,"And it's going to -- the -- you know, I told her that I just -- I want the color brown to be as an integral in the wedding.  And, um, maybe some greens and blues."
hap,She's okay with it.
hap,"Well, I mean I just told her--Well I just said, you know, hey, these are my suggestions."
hap,All fruit and the color brown. Just that. That's all- that's my only request.
hap,Yeah.  Well maybe--maybe you're right. Maybe there's something to that.
neu,"So, um, anyway, do you want to order now?   So, um I mean--"
neu,Well there has to be something you haven't tried.
neu,What about like a temp agency?
neu,"Have you gone, like, signed up with a temp agency?  Maybe they can help."
neu,"Right, but you have -- I mean, you have to keep on them.  You have to keep calling and reminding them that you're still looking and"
neu,"I mean, you have to be really aggressive about it."
neu,"Well, I mean, if it's that bad, maybe you're gonna have to take something that doesn't really fit, you know.  Like maybe you'll have to do something else for a while.  Find a new field, new skill."
neu,"Well then you're choosing to be unemployed, really."
neu,"If you're not willing to try and work with it and find something and, you know, I mean, there are things you could do."
neu,"Well maybe, you know, your luck it is just down and the market for your particular field is down and maybe you just need to look into doing something else for a while."
neu,"I mean, I'm not saying that you should, you know--"
neu,It's my fault 'cause you didn't do what I told you to?
neu,Well that sounds like your fault.
neu,You didn't do what I told you to do.
neu,I think maybe you can't get employed because you aren't willing to take responsibility for your own actions.
neu,Really?  Whose fault is it you don't have a job?
neu,[LAUGHTER]
fru,"Oh, man, I just -- I don't know what to do.  I don't know what to do.  It's like every job, you know, I go to; every job I apply to,"
fru,"it's just like nobody- nobody wants to hire me. It's been years, I mean, do you understand, years?  Like, I'm -- you know what I mean, it's like I've been collecting unemployment for so long now, it's just like I just -- I can't take it.  I don't know what to do.  I mean, I'm just like losing my mind."
fru,"I-I'm not kidding.  I've tried everything.  Like I've gone to every business and local, you know,"
fru,"local business in- in the area and I can't- I can't get anything.  Like, nobody -"
neu,"there's just like no jobs available.  I mean, it's just like, God."
fru,"Yeah, I tried that.  And there was like, yeah, like I did like one thing once.  But, like, that's not -- it doesn't last very long.  And it's not enough to live on."
fru,"Yeah, I do.  I do.  You don't understand."
fru,I- You don't understand. I don't have a job.  All- My job is to look for a job.  I don't do anything else.
fru,"But, like, it's been years now and I just can't seem to get anything that really fits.  It's just it -- I -- it drives me absolutely insane."
fru,"No, no, no, no, no.  I can't- I can't do that.  I can't, I- because if I'm not- if I'm not- if I'm not doing something that I love, then I can't -- I can't- I mean it's- what's the point?"
fru,I'm not choosing. I'm not-
fru,"No, but I'm try- but like all the things that I-it's like I apply to all these places and none of them"
fru,"-- I mean, I don't understand.  It's like -- I mean, I feel like I'm qualified enough.  I just don't understand.  Like, I mean, it's just like a matter of circumstance, but it's been three years, you know, three years."
fru,This is stupid.
fru,"You know what, this is your fault."
fru,It's your fault 'cause -cause you always told me to- to do this and I did that instead.  And I didn't take your advice and - and- but you sort of were like were telling--
fru,"Yeah, exactly."
fru,Yeah.
fru,That's 'cause you always tell me to do the wrong thing.  And I thought this time it was -- I was gonna be right by going with the opposite thing. So it's your fault because
fru,"-because you were always wrong and-and-and this time you were right. And-and I didn't -- yeah, that's why."
neu,"Well, I mean, it makes sense, doesn't it, hmm?"
neu,That's not true.  I take responsibility for my own actions.
neu,Yours.  I don't--
neu,"Hi, how can I help you?"
neu,Mmhmm.
neu,I'm sorry.
neu,Right.
neu,"Uh. Okay.  I -- first of all, I'm very sorry you lost your bag."
neu,"Um, but, actually, our policy is a fifty dollar"
neu,refund--coverage of the bag that was lost. yes
neu,"That's our policy, sir."
neu,I can't do that.
fru,I'm very sorry.  I understand you're frustrated. You just got off of a flight.
neu,We'll cover fifty.
fru,We only cover fifty do-
fru,We only cover fifty dollars worth of lost items.
fru,I'm very sorry.
neu,I'm very sorry.  I understand you're upset.  You just got off a long flight.
fru,We really -- we want to work with you. We really -- we want to help.
neu,I understand that.  I would know if it was mine. Um-
neu,But it's not.  It's yours.  I understand.
fru,I know.  We want to work with you.  We will give you the fifty dollars but I'm--
fru,"Yeah, we don't do that.  I can go ahead and send you--"
fru,"We will definitely keep an eye out for your bag. We will try to find it.  We will, you know, fill out the form for missing items."
fru,No one can make the three check thing happen 'cause we don't do that.
fru,I can write you the one check.
fru,All- all that my supervisor could do is the exact same thing that I'm offering to do.
fru,"I'd be happy to give you a cup of coffee, too."
fru,We'll just throw that in--gratuitously.
fru,"No, I don't. See, I could lose my job if I did that."
fru,And your bag is not my concern.
fru,The fifty dollars I'm going to give you for your bag is really all I'm concerned with.
fru,I'm more than happy to not argue about it.  I will give you your fifty dollar certificate.
fru,You can go ahead and go fill out the form. We'll look for your bag.
fru,Then that would be lying.
fru,I'm sorry.  We can only issue one fifty dollar certificate to cover the lost bag for one person.
neu,"I understand you're frustrated, but--"
neu,I know. I understand it's personal-- It's personal to you. I get that.
fru,"But if you want to just sit down, you know, maybe have a cup of tea, calm down a little bit, we'll go ahead and we'll do what we can for you. you okey"
fru,"And I'm looking forward to that.  However, I can't do that. I would lose my job."
fru,"Oh, yes."
fru,"I'm sorry, really.  But--"
fru,That I'm sorry?
fru,"Yeah, hi.  Look--Um, okay.  Here's the thing."
fru,lost my luggage. Your airline--
fru,"lost my luggage. I didn't lose it. No, it's not like I left it somewhere and somebody took it."
fru,"It was lost.  I waited on the conveyor -- near the conveyor belt to see, you know, where -- then the baggage claim and see if it would- it would come out."
fru,"Didn't come out.  I spoke to somebody, a local authority figure."
fru,"And he told me to come to this desk here so I can, uh, at least get, uh, the hundred- hundred and fifty dollars that- that I'm owed for my loss."
fru,'Cause that's roughly how much the bag plus all its contents was worth.
ang,fifty dollars?
ang,"fifty dollars. No way, no."
ang,"I don't but the thing is, I don't care about your policy."
ang,You understand?
fru,"What I want you to do is I want you to write three of those, as if I were three people.  Okay.  You can write -- you can just put my name on all --"
fru,But what I'm telling you is that's what you're going to do.
ang,"No, no, because, look, I don't care what your policy says.  I mean--"
ang,You understand that the contents of my bag- The contents of my bag cost a hundred and fifty dollars.
ang,You--
ang,No.  No.  No.  What I need you to do -- I need you to write checks for -- I need you to write three of them. That'll be satisfactory.
ang,"Just -- you can fill out the form--We can fill out - no, no, no, we can fill out the form three times."
fru,And then that'll be that. It's going to be fine. Just-
fru,"You don't understand. You don't understand, actually.  You don't understand because it was my luggage that was lost.  Okay."
ang,"Yeah.  If it was yours, but it's not. It's mine.  Okay. So just--"
fru,You- you- you- you're misunderstanding me.  You're going to do that.
fru,"Look, can I just -- can I speak to your manager, please?  'Cause I- I really -- I don't, um -- I mean, I just don't want to deal with -- I know that -- I mean, I know this isn't your fault,"
ang,but I need to speak to somebody who can make the three check thing happen.
fru,"But what I'm talk -- but I'm just,just- please let me--"
fru,But if I could just speak directly -- if I could just speak directly to your-- to your superior person
fru,then that would be helpful to me because I just feel like if- you don't think you have the power to write three checks but you actually do. see?
fru,But your job is not my concern. My concern is getting my luggage.
fru,"Look, I don't -- look, can we just not argue about this.  Like--"
fru,So what if- what if we- what if we do three forms
fru,with different names on them? That-
fru,"but, no. See, 'cause"
fru,if we have three forms then I can get the hundred and fifty.
fru,"Just please, will you please just work with me here? Just -- all I'm asking you to do is just work with me. I know -- I know that you get lots of people all day long who give you shit, give you crap, but"
fru,"um, you know, I -- this is my bag and I need the hundred and fifty dollars. Please."
ang,Please.
ang,"I'm already calm. Okay, I'm calm. I'm calm."
fru,"Just all I need you to do is just fill out three forms and I'll leave you alone forever, forever.  I'll never -- we'll never see each other again."
fru,But that's not going to-- But you don't understand. You're looking forward to never seeing me again.
fru,But never seeing me again is not going to happen until you give me the three checks.
fru,I don't -- I'm not- I'm not convinced.
ang,"Yeah.  If you were really sorry, you'd give me the three checks."
ang,"So why don't we just do that and stop this nonsense, hmm?  Hmm?"
sad,"Hey, how you doing?"
sad,I'm sorry.
sad,"I know- I know there's nothing I can say that will really help, but--"
sad,I'm sorry.  It's never easy.
sad,"But, I'm here if there's anything you need.  I mean, you just have to ask.  I know --"
sad,--it doesn't really do anything.  But--
sad,I know.  It never is.
sad,"How's, um -- how's his parents doing?"
sad,"I mean, what do you want to do?  Do you want to- do you want to talk about it?  Do you-"
sad,"Well I know it's not a lot of help or anything, but at least you got to know him.  I mean, at least you had the time with him that you did."
sad,"I mean, we can be grateful for that."
sad,You feel that way now because you're upset.  But you don't really think that.
sad,"It'll get better.  I know it doesn't help, but it will get better and you will remember all of the good things that you guys had; all of the memories that you have with him that were happy and you'll be grateful for those."
sad,"I agree.  If I knew how to make that happen, I would certainly help you."
sad,"When's the service? Can- can we help?  Is there anything, I mean--"
sad,"Seems like if the whole world's sad, then it's okay for you to be."
sad,I know.
sad,"I don't have any magic answers.  But,"
sad,"I mean, as- as cliche as it is, as long as people who loved him remember him, then it's not a waste, you know."
sad,Thanks.
sad,"I know.  I just -- I don't know.  It's just weird because you have somebody who's, you know,"
sad,a major part of your life and then they're gone.  And I don't know.  That's not really -- it's never really happened to me before.
sad,Yeah.
sad,Thanks.
sad,I just -- it's just not fair.
sad,"I mean, they're, you know, they're upset.  It's like you know, they"
sad,feel the same way everybody else does.
sad,"[BREATHING] I mean, there's nothing really to talk about.  He's gone and I'll never see him again."
sad,Yeah.
sad,"Yeah, I don't know.  Sometimes I wish I didn't know him.  So I wouldn't--"
sad,This is just -- this is a terrible life.  I just don't understand.
sad,"I mean, it's just not fair.  Like, I don't know.  Why people -"
sad,"there should just be some sort of rule that people don't die until they're older, 'cause then, at least, it's expected."
sad,I don't know what to do.
sad,"I mean, you- you can go.  I don't know.  I don't know what else."
sad,I hope it rains.  Somehow that'll make me feel more comfortable.
sad,Yeah.
sad,I just wish there was some way to just bring him back to life magically.
sad,"Just, you know, some thing; some genie. I need to find a genie bottle."
sad,I know.
exc,I didn't even
exc,know you applied to U.S.C..
exc,"That's amazing.  I've seen it on TV. Um, Wow.  I mean, well what are you going to major in?  What are you going to do?"
exc,Right.

exc,Is U.S.C. known for its history program?
exc,I know.  It's a great school and you know
exc,It's all about the connections
hap,"Oh, you did not just say that."
exc,I know.  You're going to be so close.
exc,I'm glad you did.
exc,"That's great.  I mean, I'm really glad you're not going to go anywhere.  You'll still be here."
exc,Everything in LA is twenty minutes away.
exc,Give or take. [LAUGHTER]
exc,Well congratulations.
exc,Yeah.
exc,"But, congrats on the U.S.C. thing."
neu,"The -- what, the- I mean--"
neu,"Okay.  Well that's cool, too, but like--"
exc,"Wow, you are a winner and a half. [LAUGHTER]"
neu,Excuse me?
neu,No.
exc,"Alright, so you're not going to believe this.  But I went home today. I looked through the mail.  And I got an acceptance letter from U.S.C.."
exc,I'm going to U.S.C.. Yeah.
exc,"Yeah, yeah."
exc,"I did.  I did. I've -- yeah, I applied to U.S.C..  I mean, it's really expensive but"
exc,it's a really good school.  So
hap,"Yeah.  I like to know about history, 'cause, you know, it's- it's just so relevant to the present."
hap,Yeah.
hap,"And, uh-"
hap,"Um, you know, I don't think so.  But I think that, you know, it's still a private school"
hap,"and right you know it's still- and then, you know, I mean-"
hap,"I'm guessing, you know it's like I I checked it out.  And, like, they have a decent history program."
hap,"So -- and like the geology just is awesome.  It rocks, no pun intended. [LAUGHTER]"
exc,"Um, but, uh- anyway -- yeah, so that's awesome, though, because you live here and then we're not going to be separated by me going to some other school"
exc,"And, uh, it's just really exciting.  I- You know, I'm -- just I want to- I want to share this special happy moment with you. It's awesome"
exc,"umm, and I'm going to check out school and get, you know, check out the courses"
exc,find out all this stuff.  And- and I don't know.  I think I'm going to try to live in a dorm.
neu,"Ouch.  That's, um -- oh, wow."
neu,"No, no, I mean, I didn't know -- I didn't know that about you. Um, I feel like --"
neu,I'll go to basketball games.
neu,Maybe some golf matches.
neu,I don't know.  Do they have golf?  Do they have- Does U.S.C. have a -- I don't know if they have a golf team.
neu,"No, I'm not going to go to a football game."
neu,Forget it. Forget it. Forget it. No way.
neu,I do -- I will need to get a gun-
neu,"Okay.  Um, but, no, I, uh, I do need to get a gun soon, though, 'cause I mean"
neu,I need to get like a -- just a small little gun just 'cause -- or like a taser or something or just like a butterfly knife
neu,"'cause, you know, I mean, it's like If I ever want to go south of campus"
neu,Well I need to defend myself from
fru,Hi.  I've been on the phone for an hour trying to get a little discrepancy on my bill fixed.  I was charged for two hundred dollars worth of calls that I didn't make.
fru,I'm positive.  They came from like another state.
fru,"Uh. Yeah, I just gave it to the automated thing like five times."
fru,Okay.  three two three six nine seven five zero six six.  Can we move on?
fru,"Yes, and I've been through all of the menus, pushed one and star and pound and all of that stuff and I'm just trying to get through to a person who can"
fru,"take off the charges that came from like Nebraska or wherever because, obviously, I didn't make those."
fru,So can you please refund the mischarged charges
fru,I did not make the calls from B.F.E. Nebraska.
fru,So could you discretion it back?
fru,"Okay, but that's like half"
fru,of the money that I was charged that I didn't make those calls.
fru,"Okay, no, look, I- I- I- I'm really -- I'm trying to be patient.  I know this isn't your fault.  I know that you didn't do it"
fru,"but, at the same time, I have been through an hour of little robot voices telling me what I needed to do."
fru,Excuse me?
fru,How long does that take?
fru,I have to wait a few weeks for people come go through my things to get the money back that I didn't spend?
neu,You're just going to put it back on my account.
hap,"Oh, my God, thank you so much."
hap,"I really appreciate this. I know it's not policy or whatever but, seriously"
hap,make my life a lot easier.
neu,I'll
neu,"call up the Sprint call center and, uh, you know. cool"
neu,You too.
fru,Thank you for calling Sprint.  We care about everybody.  How can I help you?
neu,Are you sure you didn't make them?
fru,"Can I get your phone number, please?"
fru,I'm going to need it again.  I need to look at your file.  If you want me to look at your file--
neu,Okay.
neu,"Umm, Miss Aruckman"
neu,I am seeing the two hundred dollar charge.
fru,Well I'm looking at these.
neu,So you're saying that you didn't make these calls.
fru,"Well I mean, I'm supposed to use discretion in the situation and, um--"
neu,All I can do for you right now is give you a hundred dollars.
neu,What I can
neu,What I can do for you is give you a hundred dollars right now and fill out complaint form
neu,which you- which you'll have to go into a local Verizon dealer--  or Sprint.
fru,"Ma'am, I understand that."
fru,"Ma'am, I - I - I understand that. I understand that. What I can do for you right now is what I'm telling you is that I can do- I can give you a hundred dollars back and then you'll have to fill out a complaint form and then you'll get -- there'll be some investigation. Some men will show up at your house and go through your things."
fru,And then then you'll get some money back.
neu,A few weeks.  You won't even know that they were there.
fru,"Okay.  You know what?  I just don't feel like doing this anymore.  Um, you can have all the money back, two hundred dollar, right now."
neu,"Yeah.  That's fine.  I just -- that's fine. Yeah, I mean, it doesn't make any difference to me.  I mean, it's not like it's going to cost my job or anything."
neu,"I mean, technically, that's policy.  But, like, I mean, I don't really care about -- nobody really cares about policy here."
neu,Sure.
neu,You're welcome.
neu,"No, no, no, it's cool.  It's cool.  It's cool.  So, um"
neu,"You know, so- I mean, are you doing anything later?  Or um"
neu,"Oh, I don't know.  I mean, I don't know.  I just thought, you know, maybe you want to get some co--I mean, I'm actually -- wait, where do you live?  Oh, you're in Los Angeles, I see.  Oh, no, that sucks 'cause I'm in, actually in Alabama."
neu,"God, that's like a whole problem with like-- But, no, I mean, hey-- if you ever"
neu,"if you ever come out to Montgomery, I mean, you know, just -- just call up, you know, call up the operator and I'll-- I'll be here. So, um."
neu,Alright. Take Care.
neu,What's he going to say?  Maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it.
sad,He's getting just like after he died.  What's the meaning in that?
fru,"What do you mean, dishonest?"
fru,What do you want to do?  Argue with him?
ang,You can't say that to him.
ang,How are you going to prove it?  Can you prove it?
ang,"To you it is and to me, but not to him.  You can talk yourself blue in the face, but there's no body and no grave, so where are you?"
neu,Why?
neu,"Well that's only your business, Chris."
ang,What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.
neu,Well you want to make sure your father isn't going to have --
fru,I'm just saying.
ang,I ignore what I got to ignore.  The girl is Larry's girl.
ang,"From father's point of view, he's not dead.  And you have no right to take his girl."
fru,"Now you can go on from there if you know where to go. But I'm telling you I don't know where to go.  See, I don't know."
fru,Now what can I do for you?
neu,How do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way father does.
neu,"The trouble is, you don't see enough women.  You never did."
ang,I don't see why it has to be Annie.
fru,"Alright, then, mom."
neu,Yes we did. Do you want to keep going?
neu,Just give it some more thought.
ang,What the hell is this?
ang,Are you crazy?
ang,You've got a business here.  What the hell is this?
ang,Must you be inspired?
ang,You don't want to think like that.
ang,"Alright.  But just don't think like that because what the hell did we work for?  That's all for you, Chris.  The whole shooting match is just for you."
ang,"But don't think that way, you hear me?"
neu,He saw it.
neu,He was out here when it broke.
fru,"I don't know the meaning of it, mom.  But I know one thing; we made a terrible mistake with dad."
fru,I don't want to argue with him but it's time he realized that nobody believes Larry's alive anymore.
ang,We've gotta say it to him.
ang,"For God's sake, three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane."
fru,"Alright, alright, alright.  Listen.  You know why I asked Annie here don't you?"
fru,You know why.
neu,Going to ask her to marry me.
fru,You know it's not only my business.
ang,"Well, then you know it's not only my business."
ang,"Sometimes you infuriate me, you know that?  Isn't it your business, too, if I tell this to father and he throws a fit about it?  You have such a talent for ignoring things."
fru,She's not Larry's girl.
fru,"I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer.  My whole bloody life, time after time after time."
fru,To hell with that.
neu,I wanted to get this settled first.
fru,Because it is.
fru,Line?
neu,"Alright, then, mom.  Did we skip something?  No.  Alright, then, mom."
neu,"Yeah, let's keep going."
fru,I've given it three years' of thought.  I'd hope that if
sad,"father forgot about Larry, we'd have a regular wedding and everything happy.  If I can't get that here, then I'll have to get out."
fru,I've been a good son too long; a good sucker.  I'm through with it.
ang,The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.
ang,"Yes.  I like getting an hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, at least at evening, I want it beautiful."
neu,"Yes, on this I would."
neu,Then you help me stay here.
fru,I know that.  Just you help me stay here.
fru,"No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy."
ang,Why did he invite her here?
neu,Why does that bother you?
ang,"She's been in New York three and a half years.  Why, all of a sudden--"
ang,Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.
ang,He's not going to marry her.
ang,It's got that about it.
ang,"What's going on here, Joe?"
neu,"Now listen, kid. Now, listen."
ang,"She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not."
ang,"Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men.  Why hasn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she's waited."
ang,"Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my worst moments, I think of her waiting and I know, again, that I'm right."
ang,"Nobody in this house dares take her faith away, Joe.  Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother."
ang,"I want you to act like he's coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since he invited her here.  I won't stand for any nonsense."
ang,"Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself."
ang,Laugh.  Laugh at me.  But why did that happen the very night that she came here?
ang,She goes to sleep in his bed and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look.  Look at it.  Joe--
ang,"Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand all alone"
ang,"You, above all, have got to believe.  You."
sad,I can't help it.
neu,"Oh, God, line."
fru,What do you mean?  He grew up next door to the girl all his life.  Why shouldn't he want to -- why shouldn't he want to see her again?
neu,How do you know he's even thinking about it?
neu,Well so what?
neu,Line.
fru,"Look, it's a nice day.  What are we arguing for?"
fru,What do you want me to do? What do you want?
fru,"But, Kate--"
fru,Calm yourself.
fru,Calm yourself.
fru,"Alright, alright.  Calm yourself."
fru,Why me above all?
ang,"What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?"
hap,Every day since.
hap,"I was waiting for you, Chris.  'Til then, you never wrote and when you did, what did you say?  You sure can be ambiguous, you know."
hap,I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I've done is sit around and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.
sad,How many?
sad,"Oh, gees."
hap,What'll I do with a fortune?
sad,"Yes, I suppose there has been.  But it's going from me."
sad,I don't know where to start.
sad,"It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in command of a company?"
sad,Well I lost them.
sad,Just about all.
sad,It takes a little time to toss that off because they weren't just men.
sad,"For instance, one time it'd been raining several days.  And this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks; put them in my pocket.  That's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had."
sad,"And I got this idea watching them go down, everything was being destroyed, see?  But, to me, it seemed there was one new thing that was made,"
sad,a kind of responsibility.  Man for man.  You understand me?  And then I went home and it was incredible.
sad,"There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them was some sort of bus accident.  Then I went to work for dad and that whole rat race again.  I felt, what you said, ashamed somehow"
sad,because nobody was changed.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive;
sad,"to open that bank book; to drive the new car; to see the new refrigerator.  I mean, you can take these things out of a war, but when you drive the new car, you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man."
sad,"You have to be a little better because of that.  Otherwise, we have is really loot and there's blood on it.  I don't want to take any of it.  I guess that included you."
hap,"Annie, Annie, I'm going to make you a fortune."
neu,Fine.
ang,It's not yours.
ang,"It's ours.  It's mine, too."
ang,You kept saying my flashlight as if it's somehow just yours.  How is that supposed to make me feel?
ang,Yes.
ang,It's after eleven; let's go home.
ang,There is no point in coming down here.
fru,That's my point.
ang,So let's go home.
fru,Not particularly.
ang,I just don't.  It's stupid.
ang,"Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, flop around and then they swim away.  And then they die."
neu,What are you so excited about?
fru,This isn't a moon landing we're talking about.  It's fish.  It's fish nobody even eats.
fru,I'm just not.
ang,Yes.
ang,"Last year, you will also remember, our shoes got wet.  I got sand in my panties.  We got into a big fight over nothing.  You got a sore throat and we did not see the grunions."
fru,We didn't see them the first time either.
fru,That's the wind.
fru,About what?
exc,"Actually, I wanted to go a little farther up the coast, get away from the lights and the people, but I was afraid we'd miss it.  How you doing?"
exc,"Is that, is that - is that just foam?  I can't even tell.  Although, if you can't tell, it's probably isn't them.  It'll probably be unmistakable, don't you think?"
exc,"How you doing?  Oh, no, you know what I did?  I forgot to bring my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I should have brought my flashlight."
neu,Whose is it?
fru,"Well, sure."
exc,"I wonder, do they always run during a full moon? I can't remember if it was full last year.  Remember?"
neu,"Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket."
neu,You want my jacket?
fru,Are you kidding?  We'd miss it.  We just got here.  What's the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home?
neu,Right.
neu,"That's my point, too."
fru,"No, no, no.  That's not my point.  My point is is that there's no point in coming down here if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it?"
exc,"Honey, this is a natural phenomenon.  I mean, this only happens once a year.  It's a great opportunity.  Think about the people in Kansas.  They'd have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up."
fru,"Yeah, but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  I mean, all that flopping around is laying eggs or what do you -- spawning or mating, something like that."
exc,There's mystery here and magic.
exc,"Oh, it's a big night for these guys.  Uh, life's last orgy."
exc,"Yeah, they do. Okay.  But it's fish who do something none of the other fish do; like the swallows are returning to Capistrano; or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs, like that."
exc,There's mystery here and magic; a little bit of the unexplainable.  I don't see how you can not be interested.
exc,"no, it's just seaweed, isn't it?  Oh, man, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  I mean, think about this.  I know you're not interested, but just think about this for a minute."
exc,Out there someplace is this huge mass of silver fish heading this way.  They don't know why.  We don't know why.  It wasn't a decision.  They didn't take a vote.  No one sent them an invitation or a map;
exc,"just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one, they turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming."
exc,They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.  It's single mindedness with no mind.  Urgency that's pure urge.
exc,"They don't know what drives them.  They don't give it a name or ask a question.  They just turn, as one, and start the swim that brings them here; to this place, where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death.  Oh, man, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  All my hairs are popping up."
exc,Well so what did you think?
neu,"Look at this, goose bumps."
ang,"Goddamn it, Augie, don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  You always ask me that.  It's insulting."
ang,We just have different ideas about what this evening is supposed to look like.
ang,"We never do, do we?  Have we ever?"
fru,Twice is every time we've tried.  That's ever.
fru,You don't have any idea what I'm saying.
ang,"I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking this time will be the time, but it never is."
sad,"It was about four years ago, right after we got married.  We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  So we took off our shoes and you popped the cork."
sad,Dancing barefoot in the sand; drinking champagne from the bottle.
sad,I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.
sad,No.
sad,No.
fru,No.
fru,No.
fru,No.
ang,No.
ang,I want something to turn out the way it's supposed to.
ang,This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.
ang,"Oh, right, sure.  This is standing on the beach.   This is waiting.  This is fighting."
ang,But this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.
fru,"I know you are, Augie.  Really, I do.  I know you meant for this to be special and nice and it's the full moon and the sand and everything.  But I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else."
sad,I didn't say that.
hap,"Okay, fine.  So we're in the wrong spot, but we're with the right person."
hap,"Yeah, I noticed that.  Looks pretty on the water, doesn't it?  Big ol' white moon.  I'm sorry, Augie."
neu,Well so what'd you think?
neu,What I said.
fru,Certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.
fru,"Carla, can I ask you something?  Don't take this the wrong way, but are you having your period?"
ang,Well what's bugging you?
ang,"There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunions arrive.  They do their little fish business.  We go ooh, ah, look at the fish.  They go home.  We go home."
fru,We'll see them this year.
fru,"No, of course, not."
fru,It's just fish; nothing to get traumatized over.
fru,"I've been trying to work this backwards, but I can't seem to pinpoint the moment when we took a turn for the worse."
fru,"You were fine during the phone call from Marge.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem.  Let's see, I took a shower.  Uh, you watched the news.  You said the grunions are running tonight.  I said great, let's go.  I feel lucky tonight."
fru,"Uh,okay.  So I'm putting on my jacket; putting out the animals;"
fru,"uh, taking the car out of the gara- out of the garage."
fru,Uh.
neu,"Wait a minute, I've got it."
neu,"It was in the car, right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker?  You said let's get some champagne and I said times a wasting or something like that.  Right?  That's it, right?  You want this to be like the other time.  That's it.  Of course."
fru,"What, you want me to breathe in your ear?"
fru,You want to get married again?
fru,"What, you want a divorce?"
fru,A vacation?
ang,"Well welcome to the human race.  You think this is what I had in mind?  You think that when I proposed, I had this great fantasy going that four years down the line, we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish?  No."
ang,"And we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us, 'cause you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This."
fru,"Yes, it is."
fru,Right.
ang,"No, I know, me neither."
fru,I'm doing the best I can.
sad,"No, I know.  But still.  I know I don't make you happy."
hap,"Actually, now that you mention it, no.  I don't."
hap,"I don't know.  It seemed like a good spot to me.  I mean, look at the view you've got of the moon from here."
hap,"Shh.  If we're very quiet, the fish might come."
exc,"Oh, it sent shivers up my spine."
exc,Behave exquisitely.
exc,Certainly.  I shall probably do a court curtsey.
exc,But what's so horrible is that one can't stay happy.
exc,It's true.  The whole business is a very poor joke.
exc,Who's they?
neu,"If I laugh at everything, I must laugh at us, too."
exc,"How long will it last, this ludicrous and overbearing love of ours?"
exc,Shall we always want to bicker and fight?
exc,"What happens if one of us dies?  Does the one that's left, still laugh?"
exc,"Well that's serious enough, isn't it?"
exc,"Thank you, dear.  The same applies to you, except that if I catch you so much as looking at another woman, I will kill you."
exc,Which particular one?
exc,"Oh, Charles; that was his name, Charles.  Oh, he did wriggle so beautifully."
exc,I know you did.  You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.
exc,It went on intermittently for days.
exc,"It burnt my comb, too, and all the towels in the bathroom."
exc,That was the first time you ever hit me.
exc,"The manager came in and found is rolling about on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers.  Oh, dear."
exc,"How ridiculous. How utterly, utterly ridiculous."
exc,And very much sillier.
neu,"We'll be alright, darling.  Whatever happens, aren't we?"
exc,"I don't care, then."
exc,What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us?
exc,With the mo- with the most perfect poise?
neu,"Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love?"
neu,"You mustn't be serious, my dear.  That's just what they want."
ang,All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything.  All their sacred shibboleths.  Flippancy brings out the acid- acid in their damn sweetness and light.
sad,No.  That fire will fade along with our passion.
exc,"Let's savor the delight of the moment.  Come and kiss me, darling, before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets."
ang,Horrible thing.  I hated it.
neu,Line?
exc,How -- that was a rouser wasn't it?
neu,"As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden."
ang,That was the first time you ever hit me.
hap,"The manager came in and found us rolling about on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers.  Oh, dear."
hap,"How ridiculous.  How utterly, utterly ridiculous."
hap,And very much sillier.
exc,Not at all.  It was very pretty.  I still have it and I wear it often.
hap,"Just a little, perhaps, nothing serious."
neu,Let him kiss you.
ang,What of it?
fru,"If you hadn't been so nosey, you never would have known a thing about it."
fru,"Oh, dear.  I'm bored with this conversation."
ang,"No, thanks."
fru,I don't see why you want it.  You've already had two glasses.
fru,It seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.
ang,It's become a habit with you.
fru,"Oh, don't be so stupid."
ang,What?
fru,"No, just making myself fascinating for you"
ang,"Oh, no, it isn't."
ang,"Oh, be quiet."
neu,It's a pity you didn't- It's a pity you didn't have more brandy.
fru,It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.
ang,"Adders don't snap, they sting."
fru,They sting.
ang,I don't care.  Do you understand?  I don't care.  I don't mind if they bark and roll about like hoops.
ang,"Yes, I did, quite a lot."
ang,Mind your own business.
ang,You're quite insufferable.  I expected it's because you're drunk.
ang,You always had a weak head.
ang,"On the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy."
ang,"Oh, shut up."
ang,"Not very funny, dear.  You'd better have some more brandy."
ang,Why?
ang,There aren't any people upstairs.  It's a photographer's studio.
ang,"Turn it on again, please."
ang,"Very well, if you insist on being boorish and idiotic."
ang,Go away.  Go away.  I hate you.
ang,You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.
neu,We swapped. Listen.
ang,"Listen, indeed.  I am sick and tired of listening to you, you damn sadistic bully."
ang,Stop.
ang,Stop.  I hate you.  Do you hear me? You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.
ang,"This is the end.  Do you understand, the end?  Finally and forever."
ang,"Oh, yes, I am."
ang,"Let go of me.  You're a cruel fiend and I hate and loath you.  Thank God, I discovered in time what you're really like."
ang,Marry you again? Huh.
ang,"Never, never, never.  I'd rather die in torment. Beast brute."
ang,Swine.
neu,I didn't hit you very hard.
fru,"As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden."
fru,I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.
fru,You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.
ang,"You must admit that he was in love with you, wasn't he?"
neu,Line?
ang,You let him kiss you.  You said you did.
ang,What of it?
ang,What about me?
ang,"That's a nice point of view, I must say."
ang,So am I; bored stiff.
fru,"I'll have a little myself, I think."
fru,"No particular reason.  Anyhow, they were very small ones."
fru,You can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on.
fru,You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any at the moment.
ang,"Really, Amanda"
ang,Nothing.
ang,"Going out somewhere, my dear?"
fru,Oh.  That reply has broken my heart.
ang,"As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true."
ang,"Yes, it is."
neu,Line?
ang,It's a pity you didn't have any more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.
neu,Line?
ang,"Snap.  Oh, snap, snap, snap, like a little adder."
ang,"They -- nonsense, they have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap."
ang,They snap.
ang,"I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then, hmm?"
ang,You must have had a riotous time.
ang,"No restraint at all, very enjoyable.  You never had much anyhow."
ang,I'm not in the least drunk.
fru,I think I mentioned once before that I've only had three minute liquor glasses of brandy this whole evening.  That's hardly enough to get a child of two drunk.
ang,Very interesting.  And how about a child of four and a child of six and a child of nine?
ang,Very good idea.  I will
ang,You better turn that off I think.
ang,"There are people downstairs, I suppose"
ang,Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.
ang,Turn it off.
ang,Listen--
ang,"You're a vile tempered, loosed living"
ang,wicked little beast. And I- I hope I never see you again as long as live.
ang,You're not going like this.
ang,"No, you're not."
ang,Shut up. Shut up.
ang,"You're a mean, evil minded"
ang,little vampire And I hope to God I never set eyes on you as long as I live.
ang,Whore.
neu,"Hi, I need an ID."
fru,"Okay, I'm sorry, but I just stood in this line for an hour.  can I Is there any way I can-"
fru,"No, they told me-I'm sorry, but they told me to be in this line."
fru,"What, I mean what... what's the difference?  What do I need to do there that I can't do here?"
fru,Can you just-can I just get the right-
fru,Would you be able to put me at the front of that line?
fru,I know.  I've been in line with these people.  I understand.  I understand what it's like.  Could you please like call over and-
fru,"I hear that.  I hear that.  Thank you, but I've waited in line for so long, and I don't want to have to be here all day."
neu,"So could I maybe get the form from you, fill it out here- and maybe you could-"
fru,And how long is that going to take?
fru,I don't-
fru,"I don't have time for this today, and-"
fru,"Is there anything you can do?  Please, have some compassion.  Is there something you can do?"
fru,"Please, I don't think that's necessary.  I'm just asking, maybe you could call over and say that somebody miss informed her because I didn't pick to stand in this line.  I asked them where to stand, and they told me here."
fru,"No, they did.  The lady over there told me to stand in this line and I've been here for an hour."
fru,No.
fru,"No, I'm not, I'm sorry.I'm not stupid."
ang,Isn't there anything you can do?  Just call over and ask them if I can go to the front of the line in the other line.
ang,Why not?
fru,"Except they're going tell, are you going to tell me the right line to stand in this time at least?"
ang,"Right, well, last time they told me, it was this line, and obviously, it's not true."
fru,Do you have a manager I could speak with?
fru,Are you being straight with me?
fru,Fine.
neu,"ahh Yeah, this is the wrong line.  I'm sorry.  You need to go back over to line two B.  That's where you should have started from."
neu,"Well, I have no camera here.  I can't help you at all here, ma'am.  I have forms for something completely different.  You need to go to a different place."
fru,"Simply step to line two A, ma'am, I'm sorry."
fru,There is a large line of people behind you waiting to be--
fru,"I don't want to be rude here, ma'am, but line two B is where you need to be.  This is the line for registration."
fru,I don't have those-
fru,"I don't have those forms, ma'am.  I can't help you.  That's why you need to go to line two A."
fru,"Ma'am, obviously I have no idea how long it's taking.  There seems to be a bit of a line there.  It looks like thirty forty people.  It could take four to five hours.  I'm sorry."
fru,"There's nothing I can do for you, ma'am."
fru,"But, obviously I don't have time for you to stand here and waste my time in this line.  There are other people who need service behind you who are waiting for the right things."
fru,"I am a very compassionate person, and I'm offended that you imply that I'm not.  Of course, I'm compassionate.  Look, I work in the D.M.V..  What do you think I am?  Go wait in line two A."
fru,Don't ask me to have somebody else come over here and move you myself.  I can't come back over there.  I'll get security if you need me to.
fru,"what, no, I'm sure they did not tell you here."
fru,"what The lady, what? the janitor?"
fru,"I'm not saying that you're stupid, ma'am.  I think you just said that you were stupid."
fru,"It doesn't work that way here, ma'am."
fru,There is a strict system here.  You need to wait in the right line for the right thing.  This is the line for registration.
fru,I told you it was line two A.
fru,I don't know who told you that but they were wrong.  I'm sorry.
fru,"I'm being very straight with you, ma'am.  There is nothing I can do for you.  You need to stand in line two A."
sad,um.
sad,I'm sorry.  It's just a lot ahh to explain. ahh I got a call--
sad,"I got a call today,"
sad,I'm going to need to go overseas for a while.
sad,"I don't know ""sigh""."
sad,I know.  I know.
sad,"I know.  Well, we'll have to figure all that out.  I mean, I think the Army's going to provide childcare and help us out with that. um."
sad,Iraq.
sad,I think infantry.  I'm not sure.
fru,"It's going to be at least six months, probably a year. I tried."
fru,"I know, I know.  It's really, really messed up."
fru,"Well, maybe you should move in with my mom and she can help."
fru,"I don't know, I'm just--I'm trying to think of something."
fru,You can't what?
sad,I don't think there's anything we can do.
sad,I know.  I know it's not fair.
sad,"Well, apparently nobody else can go."
fru,"I don't know.  Baby, why are you asking me this?  It's just as hard for me.  Please, try to understand that."
fru,"I understand, baby.  I'm sorry. I mean try to understand I'm I'm scared myself."
sad,I know.
sad,I know.
sad,We'll figure something out.  We just have to ... we just have to think about this.  Could any of your family help us?
sad,I'm going to miss their first words.
sad,You'll have to send me pictures and letters everyday.
sad,"Yeah, as much as I can."
sad,"""sigh"" Three weeks."
sad,Yeah.
sad,Yeah.
sad,"I love you.  I'm going to miss you so much. ""sigh"""
neu,What is it?
ang,You got called up.
ang,I thought you said this wasn't going to happen for at least a year.
fru,What am I going to do?
fru,The kids-
ang,Where do you have to go?  Where are you going?
ang,I don't understand why they would just do something like this?
ang,It doesn't make any sense.  It's stupid.  I told you you shouldn't go in the Army.
fru,I don't know I don't know what I'm going to do.  I don't know how to-
sad,I'll tell them I'm sick and that you can't leave something.
sad,It's not fair.
sad,Why has to be you?  There's all those other people.  Somebody else can go instead.  It's not right.
sad,I understand.  I'm worried about you.  I don't know what's going to happen to you.
sad,I jus-
sad,I don't know.
sad,Yeah.  I guess.  I don't know what they're going to say.
sad,"Yeah, we'll call them.  We'll figure something out.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  You're right."

hap,Exactly.
hap,"Exactly, ""laugh""."
exc,"Oh, thanks. move here before you get married [LAUGHTER]"
exc,"Perfect, okay, good. ""sigh"""
exc,"I don't feel so bad then.  Well, I'm excited for you."

hap,"That'd be great, thanks."
sad,"Brian, I need help."
fru,"I don't know.  I mean, what am I supposed to do? I've It's not for lack of effort.  I've been trying."
fru,How did you get a job?  What am I - What am I supposed to do?
fru,"I mean, I just don't--I don't know.  If you don't have a lot of qualification, where do you - where do you find work?  It's like L.A. is so frustrating because if you don't know somebody, you can't -you can't get a job.  It's impossible.  It's totally discriminatory.  You have to know somebody."
fru,It's not fair.
fru,That's fine.  I'd be willing to start anywhere.  I can't get a job.
fru,"I mean, on six seven and five an hour does not - does not pay the bills I mean."
ang,I still can't live on in six seven and five.  It's not possible in Los Angeles.  Housing is too expensive.
fru,"I mean I can do the McDonald's thing for a while as humiliating as that is, but I mean then what?  I mean You can't exactly move up in that kind of industry."
fru,"Oh come on, that's not what I envisioned for myself. Honestly, would you settle for being a manager at McDonalds?"
fru,This is humiliating.
fru,"No, I don't I don't want to accept that.  I think that's bullshit."
fru,I don't know.  I feel like I've tried everything.
fru,Three years of going out every day--every day--and looking for a job and being constantly denied everywhere I go.
sad,I'm just so scared to start over I mean.  I put so much time and energy into being here.
sad,"Where am I supposed to go?  I mean, like what?"
sad,I don't know. Maybe I can take out a loan. I just- I need prospects and I don't feel like I have any.
sad,I'm just worried.
fru,It's three years.
sad,That's really hard to hear.
sad,I feel like I have faith and now faith is running thin because there is no money.
fru,"Brian, I don't think you have a concept of what I mean by- by money.  I don't mean money like oh, I can't go get my hair and my nails done today, I mean like I can't eat."
fru,I just-- I
fru,"Yeah, I don't intend to stop trying.  I just--I don't when is when enough is enough."
fru,I don't know.
fru,"Yeah, and I look nice and I'm you know--"
fru,charismatic.
fru,"yah, to-totally, and I'm not--"
fru,"Yeah, I always think so, but I- I just feel like it's a lot of lip service everywhere I go."
fru,"Yeah, I follow up."
fru,It's just like- it's a matter of-
fru,"not tall enough, not pretty enough, not--you know how this place is."
fru,"I mean, anything."
neu,"Well, I'd like to be a working actor."
neu,But um--
neu,Yeah.
neu,"Bartending, catering."
sad,Would you be willing to make some more calls on my behalf? I won't--I won't make you look bad.
neu,yeah.
neu,Thank you.
neu,"I will, I will."
neu,"Babe, I don't know what to tell you.  Don't give up."
neu,"Well, of course not, but what are you going to do if you move back home?  Are you going to be able to find a job there?"
fru,"I wish I had some answers for you, babe.  I mean-I don't know what to tell you."
neu,I went to school and I got my degree.  And I got a job.
neu,Nothing's impossible.
neu,You have to be willing - You have to be willing to start you know at the bottom and work your way up. and
fru,I
neu,"No, it doesn't pay the bills, but it would pay something.  And it would help you get somewhere else."
neu,"and No, I understand, but you've got to start somewhere.  It's better than nothing and that's all you have.  You have nothing right now."
neu,"Wait, You can move up.  There's management programs in McDonalds and things like that."
neu,"[GARBAGE] No, I wouldn't, but I--"
neu,"Well, you know what?  Life gets humili... humiliating at times."
neu,"Well, what are you going to do about it to make it different?"
neu,Have you?  There's got to be something else.
fru,"I don't know what to tell you, babe. Maybe- Maybe you're right.  Maybe you do have to go someplace else.  I don't know, maybe it's just not meant to be here.  I mean I want you to-I don't want you to give up, but I mean I don't want you to move away, but at the same time, I don't like seeing you like this."
neu,"If it's rent or something like that, I mean I can help you out a little bit, if- if that will help you you know stick with it."
neu,"Well, just don't give up. And there's- you know, You never know, something might be around the corner tomorrow."
neu,"Well, you know I'm not going to let you starve."
fru,"I understand, but you know what, you've been negative for three years."
neu,"It's the way it seems to me.  You started complaining about not being able to find a job the first day you went out and didn't find a job.  And I'm not saying like and not trying to you know put you down or anything, it's just that-"
fru,"But it's true, babe.  You've got to be more positive about things.  Like- Have some faith in yourself."
neu,"Well, exactly.  Money is not everything."
fru,You can.
neu,You know I would never let that happen.  I wouldn't let that happen.
neu,"You can always stay with me if you- if you have to stay with me for a while and get yourself back up on your feet again.  You know I'm not just going to you know just throw you to the wolves or something like that.  If there's any way I can help you, I will."
neu,But you have to keep trying.  You can't give up.
neu,"And you've got to think--well, ask yourself why are they not hiring you?"
neu,I mean are you going in for interviews?
neu,Are you presenting-
neu,putting your best foot forward? or you
neu,"Do they seem to like you? I mean, Can you get any read from them?"
neu,Have you ever called them back and asked why you didn't get the job?
neu,Do they give you any specifics as to why they didn't go with you?
neu,"Yeah, I understand. maybe What jobs are we talking about?"
neu,Like- What's your ideal job?  What do you want to do?
neu,Of course.
neu,"Everyone wants to be a working actor, but they all work at something else."
neu,So what's the something else?
neu,"You can't get a catering gig?  Well, I can call some friends.  I- Well, I did call some friends before, but you went in once and then never went back."
neu,If I- If you- Will you stick with it?
neu,"Okay.  Okay, I'll call some people."
neu,"But you've got to keep looking for other stuff. You've got to do it on your own, too.  Okay?"
neu,You know I'll always help you.
neu,"Hi,um- I think my baggage was lost, and I need to I guess file a claim or I don't know what."
neu,Um-Seventeen. Coming from --
neu,It was Virgin Atlantic coming from London.
fru,"Yeah, I don't know where it was lost.  I was coming from Africa, so."
neu,Right.
neu,Yeah.
neu,That's good.
neu,"Well, I can't leave without it. I mean, Could you find out?"
fru,"Right, well can you get on the computer maybe and like track it down and see when it's going to get here?"
fru,"Yes, sir, I know what my bag looks like."
neu,Um- It's a travel backpack.  It's green and gray.  It's got my name on it and my information.
fru,"No, it didn't turn up at the baggage claim."
fru,I mean we've gone through all of this.  I've been to five people already who--
fru,Okay.
fru,"Yes, lots of really like -- sentimental value only, but--"
fru,Does this happen often?  Do they--you just lose baggage and you just offer people money for it?
ang,Uh- Not lose the baggage in the first place. I mean You're offering a service here. I paid so much money for that ticket.
ang,"No, but I mean like why can't- why can't you find it?  Where did it go?  Who lost it?"
ang,"Well, I just-I paid so much money for this ticket.  I feel like you guys should be able to get-to offer me more than a fifty dollar voucher."
ang,"Yeah, meaning I didn't die in a fiery plane crash.  How convenient, but um- I paid two thousand dollar to ride your airline, and I would really appreciate getting my bags there to my destination in one place."
ang,"Right, but part of the agreement is that I'm paying so that I can take myself and my belongings with me."
ang,And that you're going to transport them safely from one place to another.
ang,"That's all you can offer me? I mean, my the stuff in there is worth way more than fifty dollar."
fru,Why do I need flight insurance?  Why don't you guys just guarantee that you're going to get the stuff that I leave with to my destination?
fru,"Right, but if I'm riding a bus, I don't need to buy luggage insurance that the backpack I take on is going to get to my destination with me."
fru,Because they made me check it.  It's too heavy.
fru,There's nothing else you can do?
ang,I don't believe that for a second.
ang,What do you mean as you can?  Who makes up these rules?
ang,You're an autono- autonomous human being.  You could- You could go into the com-
fru,"So I'm just supposed to oh, well, oops, my luggage is gone and be fine with that and take your stinking fifty dollar voucher?"
fru,And you have no guarantee.
fru,This is ridiculous.
fru,"Uh- Because you guys lost it, so it should be your responsibility to find it, too."
fru,"Oh, come on.  Would you cut it out?  This is ridiculous."
ang,"No, I don't think I am.  I like have a whole bunch of stuff that means a lot to me, and I brought it you know from Africa.  It's not like I can just go back and get it whenever I want."
ang,It's not like I can go to Kmart and buy another.
fru,"Yeah, I'll take your fifty dollar voucher."
fru,Thanks.
neu,"Okay, what flight were you on?"
neu,On what airline?
neu,"From London, okay. Um- And you went through all your proper checkpoints?"
neu,So you haven't seen your bags since Africa. You flew threw Heath Row to here.
neu,"Okay.  Well, let me see here. I-"
neu,It seems like it went through Heath Row.  I see it here. uh-
neu,But uh- I don't see it here in the airport yet. uh
neu,I'm not sure where it is.  We can absolutely keep an eye out for for it for you.
neu,"Well, I'm not a miracle worker.  I don't know what I can do for you.  I don't have the bag right here."
neu,"Well, as I told you, it left Heath Row and it seems to have arrived here.  But if you can't find it, then-are you sure you know what your bag looks like?"
neu,"Okay, and what is that?  What kind of bag is it?"
fru,And you couldn't find it?
neu,Are you sure?
fru,"Well, obviously, that wasn't me, so I'm going to have to ask you the same questions they asked you just so we can get to the same point."
neu,"All right?  Now, um- it's green, travel bag, you couldn't find it.  And was there something important in it that you need it?"
neu,Sentimental value.
neu,"Right.  Well, I don't know what to tell you. Um- What I can offer you is a fifty dollar voucher on your next flight."
neu,"No, I understand. I mean. It's got to be tough all those sentimental things, but um- this is all I can do for you."
neu,"Well, you know, sometimes that's--really, I mean what else could we do?"
neu,"Well,"
fru,Obviously ma'am.
fru,"I am sorry, ma'am."
neu,"Let's- Let's just relax for a moment, ma'am.  You understand, obviously, we're going to do everything we can to keep all of your luggage here."
neu,"Obviously, we're not trying to lose your luggage.  Do you really believe that we're trying to lose your luggage ma'am?"
neu,"Well, we're talking about one bag.  You personally made it here, didn't you?"
fru,That's what the cost of the ticket was for.
fru,"Ma'am, international flights are not cheap and there's many reasons for that.  It does not have solely to do with your baggage or-"
fru,"Right. Yes, ma'am."
fru,"Right, and also if you'll read the fine print of your agreement you'll see that while we do bear some responsibility for lost luggage, it is a fifty dollar voucher."
neu,"Well, I understand that.  Did you buy flight insurance?"
neu,"Well, my hands are really tied then."
neu,"Well, it's like any kind of insurance.  You don't-when you get it, then you get more. You know, Like if you--"
neu,"Well, of course not because you've got your backpack with you the whole time.  Now, if you--you said this was a travel bag.  Why weren't you carrying it on if it was so important?"
neu,"Uh, so it was really heavy."
fru,"Well, you know what, it could still turn up, but until then I can offer you this fifty dollar voucher."
neu,"I'm sorry, ma'am, there's nothing else I can do.  My hands are really tied here.  I really wish there was something else I could do for you."
neu,Well I don't know why you wouldn't believe that.
fru,"Obviously, I'm doing everything that I can here."
neu,"Well, I have no way to give you more money.  I'm giving you as much money as I can, and figuring- as far as figuring out where you bag is-"
neu,makes up?
neu,"The airline makes these rules, mom ma'am."
fru,"Well, you can take my stinking fifty dollar voucher and go home and wait and see if your luggage turns up. And if it does, then we'll deliver it to you."
fru,"I have no guarantee, absolutely not."
fru,How can I guarantee finding your luggage when it's lost?
fru,"Right, well, when you're at home and you lose something, do you guarantee that you're going to find it later on?"
fru,"Well, it sounds to me like you're being ridiculous"
neu,Right.
fru,"I understand that, ma'am, but things get lost.  There's nothing I can do about that.  Things happen.  Accidents happen."
neu,"And while I really would love to be able to hand you your bag right now, obviously I can't do that."
neu,So you'd like the fifty dollar voucher?
neu,"Okay, just fill out these three forms, and um- you'll- we'll have that sent to you within the next three weeks and, of course, we'll definitely keep an eye out for your bag."
neu,You have a wonderful day.
sad,A good friend of mine passed away the other day.
sad,"Oh they had some pretty progressive cancer,"
sad,"metastasized and it was old and they knew that it wasn't looking good, but-"
sad,Yeah.  We were.  Pretty close.
sad,[BREATHING]
sad,Kind of.
sad,"It's hard to watch when it's painful for them, you know."
sad,"I just, I don't know."
sad,I know.
sad,And he could of...  He was pretty awesome
sad,"Uh,  We grew up together."
sad,"Yeah, he kind of did a lot of things, but we acted together, sometimes."
sad,"I feel really bad for his family, you know."
sad,"It must be really, really hard to lose a child."
sad,"Yeah.  And they were really supportive, like through the whole process, but-"
sad,[BREATHING]
sad,I can't imagine what his- what his parents are going through.
sad,"Yeah, I'm just going to miss him."
sad,Thank you.
sad,"Yeah, they're going to do some sort of memorial service or something."
sad,Thanks.
sad,"It's really bizarre, you know, when you know somebody really well, and then..."
sad,something happens and they die and it's like-
sad,"really hard to imagine that like you're going to continue to live, and that person's just going to have stopped."
sad,[BREATHING]
sad,yeah.
sad,It's hard to say good-bye.
sad,[BREATHING]
sad,yeah yeah.
sad,"Oh no, I'm so sorry. What happened?"
sad,That's the worst.  I'm so sorry.  Did you know him well?
sad,"I am so sorry,  It's-"
sad,It's the worst when they go like that. [GARBAGE] Was he young?
sad,"Absolutely, absolutely."
sad,It's the think
sad,There's no reason for it.
sad,Yeah?  What'd he do?  What did they do?  How'd you know him?
sad,yeah.
neu,"Is he an actor too, or-?"
sad,"Yes of course, of course."
neu,Was he very close to his family?
neu,yeah.
sad,Of course not.  You have no idea what it's like to lose a kid.
neu,Is there a funeral planned? or-
neu,"Cool, Well, If you want me to go with you, I will."
neu,No problem.
sad,"Right, it just doesn't make any sense, it's not real.  It doesn't feel real."
neu,yeah.
neu,"Do you know what, it's going to pass,eventually, I mean it'll never pass, it'll always be there, and you'll always remember and everything like that, but you know.  It'll get easier I guess."
neu,That's the best way to put it.
neu,Absolutely.
neu,"Do you know what, if it was me that died, I'd really want you to be crying and being really upset too any way. So, I think you should definitely do this, because it's trying what it's supposed to be."
exc,So guess what.
exc,I got into college.
exc,U.S.C..
exc,yeah.
exc,No.
exc,I'll stay in town.
hap,Uh- I don't know.
neu,"Well, I don't want to, I don't want to live with my mom."
exc,Whoa.  What an idea.  Where would you want to live?
exc,"Whoa, this is going to be so much fun."
exc,"Thank you. I know, I'm really, really, really excited."
exc,"I know they have a really, really great program for what I want to do."
exc,Can we for real live together?
exc,awesome.
exc,So should we get a place near campus? or-
exc,okay.
exc,It's going to be ridiculous.  It's going to be so cool.
exc,"[LAUGHTER] Oh, I'm going to be working too, I mean."
exc,I- I hear the same.
exc,"I don't know how I feel about that, but-"
exc,oh yeah.
exc,oh yeah.
exc,"[LAUGHTER] Oh, it'll be awesome, that's for sure."
exc,Better than if I'd picked up and moved to Boston.
exc,[LAUGHTER] by yourself.
exc,you'd be that kid
exc,"living near campus, and not going to school."
exc,[LAUGHTER]
exc,yeah.
exc,We should go apartment shop-er-hunting.
exc,Let's go tomorrow.
exc,yeah.
exc,Woo-
exc,exciting.
exc,what
exc,"Shut up.  What'd you get, where'd you get accepted to? please"
exc,"Oh, sweet."
exc,So you're not going to leave me.
exc,"oh, good good good good good good."
exc,Are you going to live on campus?  Where are you going to live?
exc,Uh! stay over here.  Like travel to school. because you are so close to me
hap,"Okay, you're right, you're right, you're right,  right.  Maybe we should get a place together."
exc,That'll be awesome.
exc,"I don't know.  Well.  I wouldn't mind living by the U.S.C. campus, you know, but I'm not going to go to school right now, so."
exc,But I'd love to go all the US- all the U.S.C. parties and do all that crazy stuff with you.
exc,it is going to be so much fun. Yes.
exc,Uh! I'm so happy that you're not going to go away.
exc,"Oh, I bet you're going to love it too.  You always wanted to go to U.S.C.."
exc,"You're going to have so much fun.  And there's lo- tons of people, you're going to meet so many people, I'm going to meet so many people too, because we're going to be there together."
exc,"Sure, why not.  I don't know why not, I'm not doing anything I have no plans, I could live anywhere I want."
exc,That'll be great. That'll be great.
exc,"We should try to find, like, a party spot though, like you know where there's going to be a lot of parties, where there are cool people, though.  Do you know any people that might be out there?"
exc,"Yeah, me either."
exc,"[garbage] I know, I know, I know, we'll figure it out.  Right?  [garbage] it is going to be so much fun."
exc,"You can't make fun of me because I'm not going to school, though, because I'm going to be working though."
exc,Woo- I I do.
exc,I know exactly how you feel about that. I think you feel really excited about it.  I know you are. I can tell. I know you.
exc,You're a wild and crazy woman.
exc,"Uh huh, it will be awesome."
exc,"living near the U.S.C. campus by myself, not going to school there. just really pathetic and sad."
exc,"Exactly.  Mooching off of all like the college experiences, that would've been me but you have saved me from that disaster. Thank you. Thank you very much."
exc,"Oh, it's going to be so much fun."
exc,"Well, congratulations. and to me too, because now I get to-have-"
exc,That's a good idea.
exc,"Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow-"
exc,"Good.  We'll have to have one soon, you're going to have to go to school in a couple of months."
exc,"Oh God, it's awesome... There's going to be tons of places. [garbage]"
neu,"Hi, sir.  How can I help you?"
neu,Okay.
neu,"[LAUGHTER] All right.  I'm sorry, sir that you've been having a hard time."
neu,"I kwon, it is ridiculous"
neu,"yeah, I understand."
neu,Uh- when's when's-
fru,Sir-
neu,"If yeah, well if you just slow down we'll um, we'll definitely have your problem solved and after we have your problem solved, then I can transfer you to a manager, someone who can you know, you can voice your complaint to, who will be able to something about it."
neu,"Okay, so where?, okay, all right, so where did you uh- locate your your bill?"
neu,In the mail?
neu,"So is it, is- is it at all possible that maybe this statement is just old and that the transaction hadn't been processed yet?"
neu,Okay.
neu,Okay.
neu,"Okay so, I'll just look it up and you know see what's going on, maybe we can..."
neu,if I call it up on the screen.
neu,"So in the database, it looks as though um, there is a there is like a glitch in the transaction where it hadn't gone through before, but I do see that you paid the, what can you tell me the amount, what was the amount?"
neu,"Okay, I do see that on here, and it says that um, it had some trouble clearing for some reason.  And I think that was the problem on our end.  So um-"
neu,"Well you know sometimes-- just with online transactions, things happens. so um-"
neu,"Yeah, we- Somebody went in and- and cleared the problem and it looks like you're all paid."
neu,"You do the direct the direct it um- it's taking right out of your bank account, correct?"
neu,Yeah so- That --that did go through.
neu,"Um- I can try to do that for you, certainly."
neu,"Right, right, and since--yeah, since it was just a computer glitch, then that's that should be cleared up as well.  So I'm going to go ahead and try and put that into the computer.  And if for some reason you notice on your statement in a few days that you've been charged and an overdue fee, then you should just call back and we'll have that."
neu,Well I'll give you my direct line and my number so you can- you can  get directly to me.
neu,yeah.
neu,No problem.
neu,ahh one eight hundred three two three
neu,six four nine four
neu,You're welcome
neu,I'm sorry that it was an inconvenience.
neu,Have a good day.
neu,bye bye
fru,"Oh, thank God.  Do you know how long I've been on the phone for half an hour trying to talk to a freaking human being."
fru,"All I want to do is put my, pay for my freaking credit card, and there's something wrong in my bill, Like I swear, it says I didn't paid last month, but I know I paid last month."
fru,"I put- I've been typing my number in millions of times, it won't listen to me, it's not working, and I can't get a single human being, and finally-"
ang,"This is ridiculous.  I- I seriously, I don't understand why you think these automated systems are supposed to like work for anybody.  They have never, ever work for me."
ang,"Can you like talk to somebody about this, can you like can you tell them that this is ridiculous and can they change it from now on, is there a phone number you have that I can call that will like automatically be talking to somebody a human being."
fru,"Well, okay ,well First off, fine, fine, fine.  Let's see, first off, um- yeah my bill's wrong."
ang,"Like I know I paid last month, but it hasn't been paid and you charged me a late fee."
fru,I got it in the mail.
fru,yeah
fru,"Well, when I look online, it says, it says that I was charged a late fee so I'm assuming that I paid on your web site-"
fru,"like I paid right through your own company before my due date but it's still and it even shows my payment there, and then it charged me the late fee afterwards."
fru,Okay.
neu,"Okay, great, go ahead."
fru,It was one ninety eight sixty three. I paid the minimum.
neu,"No, No, No, I am grateful."
neu,Did they take-
neu,"Yes, yes, exactly."
neu,Are you taking the late fee off of my account then?
fru,Because I paid it on time.
neu,Right.
fru,"Yeah, but if I call back, I'll have to go through this whole rigmarole again. and try to get a hole or someone."
hap,"That would be wonderful, that would be great seriously."
hap,"thank you, what's the number?"
neu,three two three
hap,"six four nine four. That would be so great, thank you so much."
hap,"It was horrible, but you've made it much better, thank you very much. Absolutely"
hap,"You too, thank you so much, have a wonderful day."
sad,What's he going to say? Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.
sad,Did you talk to him?
sad,He cried hard.
sad,He is thinking about him again.
sad,"It's getting just like after Larry died, he's having dreams, he's walking around at night."
sad,What's the meaning of that?
fru,"To you it is, and to me, but not to your father.  Now look, you can talk yourself  blue in the face, but there's no body, and there's no grave, so where are you?"
neu,Well I got an idea.  But what's the story?
fru,I ignore what I got to ignore.  The girl is Larry's girl.
fru,"Now Chris you can go on from there, but I don't know what to do.  I mean do you know what to do, because I don't."
neu,"Well you're a considerate fellow, there's nothing wrong with that."
neu,Have you asked Annie yet to marry you?
neu,"Well how did you know that she will go along with it, I mean maybe she feels the same way as your father?"
neu,"The trouble is you don't see enough women, you never have"
neu,Well I just don't see why it has to be Annie.
fru,"No, I don't want a diagram, but, Chris, your father thinks Larry's coming back."
sad,"You marry his girl, and you're pronouncing him dead.  Now what's going to happen to your father, do you know?  I don't."
ang,What the hell is this?
ang,Are you crazy?
fru,Wait a minute.  Tell me this.  Do you mean to say that you would leave the business?
fru,"Don't- you, you can't think like that!  Don't think like that!"
ang,"All right!  But don't think like that, because I mean, what the hell did we do all this for, Chris?  The whole business it's all for you!  The whole shooting match is for you!"
fru,"I don't understand you, do I?"
sad,He saw it.
sad,He was out here when it broke.
sad,"Around Four this morning, and there was a crack and I looked out.  We're standing right there when I cracked."
sad,I don't know.  but When it cracked he ran back into the house and start to cry in the kitchen.
sad,No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.
sad,I could hear him right through the floor of my room.
sad,"I guess, he is."
sad,I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know one thing mom did.  We made a terrible mistake with dad.
sad,Being dishonest with him.  It's the kind of thing that pays off and now it's paying off.
sad,"You know that Larry's not coming back, and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?"
fru,"No um, I don't want to argue with him, but it's time we realized that nobody else believes that Larry is alive."
fru,"Why shouldn't he dream about him, walk around during the night, looking for him um.  Do we contradict him?  Do we say outright that we don't have any hope anymore, that we haven't had any for years now?"
fru,We have to say it to him!
ang,"For God's sake, mom, three years.  Nobody comes back after three years!  It's insane!"
fru,"Sit down, mom.  I want to talk to you."
fru,"All right, All right mom.  Listen!"
sad,"You know why I asked Annie here, don't you?"
fru,You know.
neu,I'm going to ask her to marry me.
fru,You know that's not just my business.
fru,So it's all right.  I can go ahead with it then?
fru,"I don't know why it is.  But every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer.  My whole bloody life, time after time, after time."
ang,To hell with that!
fru,"So what, I'm not fast with women."
fru,Because it is.
fru,"I can't help it.  I know her best.  I was brought up next door to here, the easiest, when I think of somebody for my wife, I think of Annie.  Do you want a diagram?"
fru,"All right, then, Mom."
fru,"I've given it three years of thought.  And hope by now that he wouldn't.  Can you forget about Larry an-- and we can have a regular wedding and have everybody be happy.  But that can't happen here, I'm set to get out."
fru,"I'll get out. I'll get married and live some place else.  Maybe, maybe New York?"
ang,The business?  The business?  It doesn't inspire me?
neu,She's been in New York three and a half years.  Why all of the sudden?
fru,"What's going on here, Joe?"
ang,She's not his girl.  She knows she's not.
fru,"She's . . . Then why is she still single.  New York is full of men, why isn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she's waited."
fru,Because she knows what I know - she's faithful as a rock and my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.
fru,"Nobody in her- this house dares shake her faith.  Strangers might, but not his father, and not his brother."
ang,I want you to pretend like he's coming back!
ang,"Because if he's not coming back, then I'll kill myself."
ang,"Laugh.  Laugh at me, but what happens the night that she goes to sleep in his bed, and his memorial breaks in pieces?"
ang,"Only last week, another boy turned up in Detroit, been missing longer than Larry, you read it yourself."
sad,You've got to believe. You've got to--
ang,I can't help it!
neu,Why does that bother you?
neu,Well maybe.  Maybe she just wanted to see her again.
neu,"What did you mean? He lived next door to the girl all of his life, why wouldn't he want to see her again? Don't look at me like that, he didn't tell me any more than he told you."
fru,How do you know he is even thinking about it?
fru,"Well, so what."
fru,"Now, listen, Kate, just-"
fru,How do you know why she's waited?
fru,Look.  It's a nice day.  Why are we arguing?
fru,What do you want me to do? What do you want--
fru,"But, Kate..."
fru,[LAUGHTER]
fru,Calm yourself.
fru,Calm yourself!
fru,"All right, all right.  Calm yourself."
ang,What do you mean me above all?  Look at you.  You're shaking!
ang,"What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?"
hap,You're the only one I know who loves his parents.
hap,"No, it's good."
hap,It's so lovely here.  The air is sweet.
hap,No.  But I'm not going to stay.
sad,Well sort of embarrassed soon as I came.
neu,"Well, from her point of view why else would I come?"
hap,I guess this is why I came.
hap,I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait so long?  All this time I've been wondering if I was a fool for thinking of you!
hap,"Not like that, you're not."
hap,"Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  Chris, what's the matter?"
sad,It wouldn't work like this.
neu,yeah sure.
sad,how many?
sad,Oh gee.
neu,Do you still feel like that?
sad,"Because you can't feel like that anymore Chris, you hear me?  I mean everything that you have, you deserve.  And that includes me.  And your father?  Your father put hundreds of planes in the air, you should be proud.  A man should be paid for that."
hap,What would I do with a fortune?
hap,I know.  It's going out of style isn't it?
neu,What?
hap,Well the plan was to kind of sneak up on you over a period of a week or so.  But uh- they take it for granted that we're all set.
neu,How did you know?
hap,"Anne, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you!"
exc,"I- I -I have no imagination, that's all I know what to say, I-I'm embarrassing you. I I didn't want to tell you here.  I wanted it to be some place different, some place where we could be new to each other you know."
exc,"You feel it's wrong here, don't you- this yard, this chair?  I want you to be ready for me Annie.  I don't want to win you away from anything."
exc,Oh God- I kissed Annie! I can't believe I kissed Annie!  How long I've wanted to do this.
exc,"Oh Annie, we're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy."
sad,"Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me."
sad,"It's- It's mixed up with so many other things, I-"
sad,Remember when I was overseas?  I was in command of the company.
sad,Yeah.  I lost them.
sad,just about all.
sad,Takes a little time to toss something like that off you know because they weren't just men-
sad,"for instance, there's this one time.  It had been raining for several days.  And this kid came up to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks. you know, He just put them in my pocket."
sad,"I know that- that's not a big thing, but it's just the kind of guys I had. They didn't die. They- They killed themselves for each other."
sad,I mean that exactly that-a little more selfish and they would have still been here today.
sad,"And I got an ideal, watching them all go down.  Everything was being destroyed see and-"
sad,"but it seemed to me that something new was being created at the same time, a kind of responsibility, man for man.  Do you understand me?"
sad,And to show that-to-to bring that back onto the earth again like a- like a monument.  And everyone would have it standing behind them and- and it would make a difference for them.
sad,And then I went home and it was incredible.  It had no meaning here.
sad,"It was all like some kind of bus accident to them.  I went back to work with my dad, in that whole rat race again."
sad,And I felt what you said- ashamed somehow-because nobody had changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a whole lot of guys. and
sad,"It felt wrong to be alive-to open that bank-book; to buy that new car; to look at that new refrigerator.  I mean, you can take those things out of the war, but if you drive that car, you have to know that that comes from the love that a man has for a man.  And you've got to be a little bit better than that!"
exc,"I I want you now, Annie."
hap,"Oh Annie.  Annie, I am going to make you a fortune!"
neu,Fine.
neu,What flashlight?
fru,It's not your flashlight.
fru,"I mean you keep saying ,my flashlight, as if it's somehow just yours.  How's that suppose to make me feel?"
neu,yes.
neu,"It's after eleven, let's go home."
fru,There is no point in coming out here.
fru,So let's go.
neu,Not particularly.
neu,I just don't.
fru,"Pass up what?  Its little fish, one month on the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die."
fru,"What are you so excited about?  I mean it's not--it's not rocket science we are talking about, its fish.  Its fish nobody even eats."
neu,I am just not.
neu,Yes.
fru,"Last year you also remember, our shoes got wet and I got sand in my panties and we got into a big fight.  You had a sore throat and we did not see the grunions."
fru,We didn't see them the first time either.
exc,"What time is it?  Isn't it supposed to start running around midnight?  This is great, isn't it?  Look at this great night we got here.  Couldn't be better--"
exc,actually I was hoping to go a little bit further up the coast to get away from the lights and the people but I was afraid I will miss it.  How are you doing?
exc,"Is that--no, no no is that foam?  I can't even tell, although if I- if I can't tell, it probably isn't it?  Right It'll probably be unmistakable, but don't you think?  How you doing?"
exc,"Oh no, you know what I did.  I forgot my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I can't believe I forgot my flashlight."
fru,"The flashlight, the silver one, there's only one, isn't there?"
fru,Whose is it?
fru,"Well, Sure."
fru,"No, Of course, you are right.  Our flashlight.  Me flashlight is you flashlight naturally.  How can we not think to bring it?"
exc,"Are you cold?  You want my jacket?  We should have bought a blanket.  Our blanket-.  This is great, isn't it?"
exc,"I didn't even think to bring a six-pack.  A six-pack would be just the thing right about now. I can't believe I forgot.  And look at kid, I am surprise I make it out of the house about flies it."
exc,[LAUGHTER] I wonder if they can hear me talk or if they can feel the vibration in the sand when we are moving around
exc,you want my jacket?
exc,Right.
fru,Why not?
exc,"Honey, this is a natural phenomenon. I mean,  It happens like once a year.  It's a great opportunity."
exc,"Think about people in Kansas, they have to get a- a plane reservation and a hotel reservation just to see this uh- but we are just forty minutes away.  Too good to pass up."
exc,"Yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives, all that flopping around is laying eggs or what you- mating or spawning or something like that."
exc,This is a big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy. Yeah
exc,"Okay, but they are fish that do something that no other fish do.  Like the swallows returning to Capistrano, or the lemmings jumping off a cliff you know like that."
exc,There's There's mystery here and magic.  A little bit of the unexplainable.  I can't understand how you could not be interested.
fru,We weren't in a good spot.
exc,"Look there, what's that?  Is it?  Is that a--Ah, it's a seaweed isn't it?"
exc,"Oh, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for the world.  I mean think about this. I know you are not interested but think about this for a second."
exc,"Somewhere out there, is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction.  They don't know why and we don't know why. They didn't get an invitation.  And it wasn't a vote- it wasn't a decision.  And nobody sent them a map or anything like that."
exc,It's just some little instinctual time-release firecracker that went off inside them and all this one they turn around and form a line as long as the California coast and just started swimming.
exc,"They are swimming right now as if it's the only thing that matters.  It's- It's single mindedness with no mind, urgency that's pure urge. It's- They don't know what drives them.  They- They don't give any name or ask any question. They just turn as one and started to swim to the very point we are standing right now for a massive celebration of sex and death.  God, it's giving me goose bumps all over my hairs on my arm. popping up."
exc,"Well, So what do you think?"
fru,I am sorry.  It's just fish to me.
ang,"God damn it, Augie.  Why do you always ask things like that?  It's so insulting."
fru,I just had a different idea of what this evening is going to look like.
fru,"For heaven's sake Augie, grow up we are not going to see the grunions."
fru,We never do.  Have we ever?  We never have.
fru,"Twice is every time we tried, that's ever."
fru,"No, we won't.  Augie it's like waiting for Santa Claus to come.  I feel like I am going to spend my entire life standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasp expectantly in front of me waiting for the fish to show up and the fish will not show up."
fru,"I did, I do want to see it.  I always want to see it, Augie."
fru,"For heaven's sake, this is not about fish."
sad,"Augie, do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago right after we got married and we thought I was pregnant."
sad,"We had a bottle of champagne but no glasses and you ask me to dance so we took off our shoes and while we were dancing, you said the most intimate things right in my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them."
hap,"And I remember thinking, Finally, finally.  I am as happy as I am supposed to be."
sad,"Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne from the bottle."
sad,I rather not remember some things.  I rather not hope for some things.
sad,No.
sad,No.
fru,No.
fru,No no.
fru,I want something to turn out the way it is suppose to turn out.
sad,This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.
sad,"Sure, this is standing.  This is waiting.  This is fighting."
sad,But this isn't anything like I thought it would be.
sad,"I mean it is just this , I mean it includes a lot and everything and you know it's the sand and it's the full moon and I just-I am sorry but I couldn't help wishing I was somewhere else."
sad,I didn't say that.
sad,"For heaven's sake Augie, wherever I am I always wanted to be with you."
sad,"Whatever I am doing, I wanted to be with you.  I mean you are probably the one who wishes you were with somebody else, somebody who didn't take everything so hard and who knows how to enjoy herself."
hap,Good.  So maybe we are on the wrong spot but we are with the right person.
hap,"Yes, I did notice that.  It does look really beautiful on the water.  The gold white moon."
hap,"No, I am beginning to think that maybe this is the spot after all."
exc,"Well, so?  What do you think?"
fru,What I was just saying.
neu,It certainly is not. It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.
neu,"I am not the only one, look at all these people."
neu,"Carla, can I ask you a question?  Now don't be upset, are you having a period?"
fru,What's bugging you?
fru,"There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunion arrives and they do their little fish thing.  And we say, Oh, wow.  Look at the little fish.  They go home, we go home."
fru,Why not?
fru,"We miss them twice, it's not ever."
neu,Well We will see them this year.
fru,I thought you wanted to see it.
fru,"It's just fish, it's nothing to get traumatize over."
fru,"Okay, I been trying to work this backwards but I can't seem to pinpoint a moment when we took a turn for the worst here."
neu,"Wait a minute, I got it."
exc,"Okay, all right I got it.  You wanted it to be like the other time, okay no problem. Listen, You want to dance?"
exc,You want me to go get some champagne?
exc,Take off our shoes?
fru,You want to get married again?
fru,What? What You want a divorce?
fru,"A vacation? A new carpet, a poodle?  A bag of ice cream, a suicide pack, what what Carla?  What the hell do you want?"
ang,What.  Welcome to the human race.
fru,"No, no I was just like you, I thought it will be all peaches and roses and- and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come. And the bills will always magically pay themselves and we will have three fat rosy kids and we will be, HAHA baby the joke is on us."
sad,"No, I know me either."
sad,Maybe if you are with somebody else too?
sad,"No, I know, but.  I know I don't make you happy."
hap,"Actually, now that you mention it.  No, I don't."
hap,I don't know.  Seems like a pretty good spot to me I mean look at the view of the moon you got from here.
hap,"Well, look what we have got here."
hap,"Shh, If we're very quiet, the fish might come."
hap,Or not.
exc,"Oh, it sent shivers up my spine."
exc,Behave exquisitely.
exc,"Yes, I shall probably do a Court Curtsey."
neu,The whole business is really rather ridiculous.
neu,Meaning exactly that.
neu,Who's they?
neu,"Well, what if-what happens when our love-"
neu,"Well, what if one of us dies, does the other laugh then?"
exc,Charles.  That was his name.  He did wriggle so beautifully.
exc,And then the manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor biting and scratching like panthers.
hap,"Oh, ridiculous. utterly ridiculous"
neu,You knew there was nothing.
exc,Good God.
exc,I wonder.
exc,Hello?  Hello?  What?  Wrong number.
exc,With the most perfect poise.
exc,"What does it all mean?  That's what I asked myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?"
exc,"All the futile mortals who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything, all their sacred shibboleths.  Flippancy brings out the acid in their damned sweetness and light."
exc,Certainly you must.  We're figures of fun alright [LAUGHTER].
exc,Who knows?
exc,"No, that fire will fade along with our passion."
exc,It all depends on how well we played.
exc,"Yes, yes, with all his might."
exc,"No, no it isn't.  Death is very laughable.  Come such a cunning little mystery all done with mirrors."
exc,"no, So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and --"
exc,enjoy the party as long as we can like very little quite idiotic schoolchildren. [garbage] Let's savor the delight of the moment.
exc,"Darling, come here and kiss me before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets."
exc,Do you remember that awful scene we had in Venice?
exc,The one where you bought that little painted wooden snake and put it on my bed.
exc,"Horrible thing, I hate it."
exc,How long did that row last?
exc,The worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt a hole in my new dressing gown.
exc,"Oh, that was quite a rouser, wasn't it?"
neu,"Oh, I didn't hit you very hard."
exc,[LAUGHTER] I shall never forget his face.
exc,"Oh, we were very much younger then."
exc,"Oh, As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden."
neu,You knew there was nothing in that.
neu,Only a trivial little broach.
neu,You worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.
neu,"maybe just a little, but--"
neu,And what of it?
neu,"Well, I- he got a lot of pleasure out of it and it didn't hurt me."
fru,I'm growing quite tired and bored of this conversation.
neu,I don't see why you want any.  You've already had three glasses.
neu,"Well, it seems silly to go on and on in such a thing."
neu,It's becoming a habit with you.
neu,Just making myself fascinating for you.
ang,"Um, It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you."
ang,"adder don't snap, they sting."
ang,They sting.
ang,"I don't care if they bark and roll around like hoops, okay."
neu,"Yes, I did quite a bit."
ang,Mind your own business.
ang,"Oh dear, you really are becoming quite insufferable.  I would imagine it's because you're drunk."
fru,"Oh, You are so insufferable.  Do you stop."
ang,"Not very funny, dear, you better have some more brandy."
fru,Ugh.
ang,Why?
ang,There aren't any people upstairs; it's a photographer's studio.
ang,They're away in Tunis.
ang,Turn it on again.
ang,"Fine, if you insist on being completely insolent."
ang,"Well, do try to control yourself darling."
ang,You really do need to develop uh a clearer head.
ang,I- I hate you.
ang,I hate you.
ang,"No, no.  I'm tired of listening to you.  You're boorish and idiotic and completely overbearing."
ang,"Yeah, very amusing.  Let me go.  I'm getting out of here.  I can't believe I intended to marry you."
ang,"Oh, marry you again?  I must have been insane.  What was I thinking?  I mean, you're completely outrageous."
ang,Beast; brute; cad; whore
ang,"You must admit that he was in love with you, wasn't he?"
ang,You let him kiss you.  You said you did.
fru,What of it?
ang,"Well, that's a nice point of view I must say."
neu,"So am I, bored stiff.  Would you like some brandy?"
neu,I'll have a little I think.
ang,You needn't be so grand simply because you don't happen to want any at the moment.
ang,"Really, Amanda."
ang,"Oh, that reply has broken my heart."
fru,"Oh, yes it is."
ang,It's a pity you didn't take a little more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.
ang,They snap.
fru,[BREATHING]
ang,Did you see much of Peter Burden after the divorce?
ang,I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then.
ang,"You must have a riotous time, no restraint at all, very enjoyable.  I mean, you never had much anyway."
fru,"Oh, This is very interesting.  We- we might get a splendid debate going about this intemperate tots."
fru,You better turn that off I think.
ang,Turn it off.  It is driving me mad.
ang,Turn it off.
ang,Turn it off.
ang,Amanda-- Listen- Listen-
ang,Very music- amusing indeed.
ang,"You are a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast, and I never want to set eyes on you again."
ang,"Shut up, shut up.  I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on bended knee. You're a mean, evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never set eyes on you again."
neu,Can I help you?
neu,"Oh, this- this form that you have is the wrong form.  You need to go over to the other line on the other side of the D.M.V.."
neu,"Right, but this is the wrong form.  Somebody gave you the wrong form."
neu,"Yeah.  So, I can't -- I can't do anything-"
neu,"No, but this is for um- replacements and you need a new -- whole new license as a California --"
fru,"Sir, don't get an attitude with me."
neu,"No, I understand and there are a lot of people here.  But what I'm telling you is that it's different for different states and since your getting a new license in the state of California -- You have to fill out a different form than you did."
fru,I don't know.  I don't know who told you.  It wasn't me.
fru,"You- You can ask her if you want, but she's busy and she probably won't answer you."
neu,I know.
fru,"Sir, you- I mean"
fru,You can waist as much as you want
neu,Yeah.  I know it's gonna take a minute.  But you-- so you might as well get started now.
fru,"I can't take this one, sir. this is the wrong form."
fru,"Sir, please don't waste my time."
fru,There is nothing I can do about it.  You need to take this other form and fill it out and go stand in the other line.
fru,"They're different forms, we process them all different-"
fru,I -- there's no way I'd make an exception.
fru,"Sir, don't patronize me.  I can't make an exception.  I don't- I don't have the power to do that.  It's a different form."
fru,They're processed differently.
fru,"Sir, you're gonna have to go stand in the other line."
ang,I'm gonna- I'm gonna bring security over and have them escort you out.
fru,But you filled out the wrong form and you're in the wrong line and you're wasting both of our times.
ang,"Well, that's unfortunate, sir.  You're gonna have to go stand in the other line now."
fru,What's the difference?  What's the difference between that form and this form?
ang,"I'm not getting a -- well, you wait in this line and not get an attitude."
fru,"Well then, when I showed them my I.D. before and I said I had to get a new I.D, why didn't they tell me to fill out the right form?"
fru,"Well, it was this girl standing right next to you.  Can we ask her why she didn't let me fill out the right form?"
fru,Do you know how long it's gonna take me to start all over and fill out the new form?
fru,Might as well get started now? but Just take this one.
fru,Why can't we just -- you know what?  How about if we just pretend that I'm getting a -- renewing my California I.D. and we just don't tell anybody -- That I'm getting a new one from a different state?
fru,"Come on!  You know -- you can't just take -- make a little exception to the rule?  I know that you guys make exceptions.  I see -- you know, if I was-if I was your friend and you knew me, or something like that, you'd probably make a little exception for me wouldn't you?"
ang,"Wouldn't you? Oh, come on.  you just tell me.  You would make an exception for me."
fru,Shh...I know you've got the power to do that.
fru,That's crap- You're crap.  I don't buy it.
fru,I'm not leaving this line until I get my new I.D.  That's as simple as it is.  I'm not leaving this line until I get my new I.D.
fru,"Well, then you're just gonna look stupid because I'm just waiting for an I.D. and you're gonna make security take me out because I want my I.D."
fru,That's just dumb.
fru,I filled out the wrong form because they made me fill out the wrong form!
fru,"This is crap.  You know, I don't even know why I'm in this state.  Screw California.  I'm out of here."
fru,"No, we have- There's got to be something you can do.  You can't go."
fru,There's got to be something we can do.  You can't just go.
fru,Why don't we do that- Can we- Can we just leave the country?
neu,What would be the worst that would happen if they found you somewhere else?
sad,"Well, they're so young."
sad,It's just so much.
sad,[GARBAGE] You have to write me everyday.
sad,okay.

sad,"Sweetheart, I've got to tell you something.  I just got a call.  I'm going to Iraq."
sad,"I know it's really crappy timing, but I don't have a choice."
sad,"I don't have a choice.  I have to go.  If I don't go, they'll come and take me."
fru,I've tried everything.  I've called everyone I know.  I've tried everything. No one can do anything for me or they won't do anything for me.
sad,I know.
sad,I don't want to -- the kids.  You've got to take care of them.  You've got- you've got to-
sad,"tell them about me and show them pictures of me and everything like that, because they are not going to see me for such a long time.  And it's such an important time and I just don't want to miss it."
sad,I don't have -- I know.  What are we gonna- What are we- just run away?  What can I do?  Where can we go?
fru,"They'd put me in jail and then how long- when will I get to see the kids?  What, ten years?  I don't know."
sad,I know.  But I'll-I'll send the pictures all the time and I'll write them emails and you can read them the emails that I send them.

sad,"I know.  I know.  I know.  But, you know what?  That doesn't mean it's gonna be me; does it?"
sad,No.  It doesn't.  And you can't think like that.
sad,I don't want you to -- I know.  I know. You can't worry about me.  You've got to worry about the kids.  And you've got to take care of the kids for me.  Okay?  Take care of the kids for me; all right?

sad,"All- I'll write you everyday, all the time.  And I'll send you pictures and you send me pictures. I know We've got email out there.  We've got email and I can see stuff and you can send me stuff all the time.  Okay?"

hap,"She--,well, she said yes, first of all, let me say that right off the bat. Well, I would like to assume, too.  But you never know these things, right?"
hap,"I did it up at Yosemite.  We went camping right like we usually do.  You know we go camping up there all the time.  But, um- the waterfalls had died down a little bit, you know. And so uh- we-I had her climb up."
hap,"You know- we did some- you know some rock climbing up the waterfalls and went up to this little pool that was up there.  And then, I- it's great. Um- You have to climb this little rock-"
hap,"and you can climb it and it's covered in algae you know. So, I wanted her to climb it to go take a picture, like, back in this little waterfall area, and she got back there and she took her picture. And then, I had her come back.  And I was going to do the same thing."
hap,"Well, instead I climb up on the rock and like I- I didn't do it -- well, I did it on purpose. I made it look like I accidentally did it.  I slipped down into this pool of water, right?  And she freaks out because I slide all the way down this rock.  And um-"
hap,"And I pop up out of the water -- and I had planned it already, you know? I pop up out of the water and I [BREATHING] and I like, grab her hand, you know.  and that In my hand, I've got the ring."

hap,Thank you.
neu,Really? It's been that long?
neu,Wow.
neu,What have you been trying?
neu,Right.
neu,"Well, I mean, right now I'm just doing a little bit of everything.  And I don't- I don't think that I'm in like a profession, like career oriented place."
neu,"No.  I'm just working in restaurants and stuff. But, I'm also trying to audition and what not.  So, it's --"
neu,Really?
neu,"L.A. is really hard.  I mean, have you tried like just going into a bar a couple of times to make friends with people who work there? and"
neu,"I was just going to say that's your issue. Maybe you are going in too much. No, I mean, just"
neu,are you going into the bars every night?
neu,"Well, I don't really know.  I don't I don't know you in like a job situation, so."
neu,"Wow.  I don't -- I mean, do you- do you have an attitude problem when you're on the job?"
neu,Maybe [garbage].
neu,"Right.  Maybe you have, like, you know a little bit of an abrasive vibe or something."
neu,I don't know.  I'm I'm just trying --
neu,Are you getting defensive?
neu,Yeah.  That might be something you want to look at.  I mean --
neu,Okay.
neu,I understand.
neu,"Yeah, it's stressful.  I recognize that."
neu,ah.
neu,"Not- Not selling pot, right?"
neu,Okay so.
neu,Fair enough.
neu,"Sorry.  So, let's see.  What else?  What's available? What? Um.  Hmm."
neu,"Well, not off the top of head.  It will just take you know take a minute.  But do you have any, like, special skills?"
neu,"Well, maybe we can find you something with juggling."
neu,Have you checked out Craig's List and stuff?
neu,"What if you do kids parties? oh, come on."
neu,Okay.  All right.
neu,"Okay.  Well, fine. we won't- I won't argue with you about that."
fru,What else?  I can't -- uh.  I'm drawing a blank here.
neu,"That's rough.  I'm really sorry, Ryan."
neu,"Well, um, is that kinda like the side of you that you let people see when you go into these job interviews?"
neu,"Okay.  Well, that's good.  Yeah, I mean, you're you're- when you're happy you're a pretty personable guy.  And I don't --I don't"
neu,I can't see where the issue would be. so
fru,"Uh, God.  I don't know what to do anymore.  Like I said --"
fru,"I don't know.  There's nothing for me out there.  I can't get a job.  I haven't gotten a job in a year, three years.  What is it, three years now; right? That I haven't been able to have a job."
fru,"Something like that.  I can't even remember anymore. I don't know what to do anymore.  I just get out there everyday -- well, not everyday, almost everyday."
fru,And try to do something. I mean-
fru,"Well, everything.  I'll do temping, you know, office work.  You know, whatever to pay the bills.  You know, I'll do anything."
fru,"But, I mean, I don't want to keep those jobs.  I don't want those jobs.It's not what I want to do."
fru,"But, I don't know.  God, what am I going to do?  Should I go back to school?  I can't- I can't afford to go back to school."
fru,What do you do?
neu,"You plan on being there forever? I mean, Like, what do you --"
neu,yeah.
neu,right.
fru,"Yeah, yeah.  Well, hello.  That's what I'm doing too.  But I can't get the restaurant job.  I can't get -- -- the restaurant gig.  No one will give me anything."
fru,"I go in for these interviews, and they're all cool and everything, you know.  Their nice and I'm nice to them, you know, give and take, back and forth, and whatever."
fru,But they always go with somebody else.
fru,"Yeah, absolutely.  Hello?  You know me.  I go to bars all the time.  Like, they all know me, you know.  But no one wants to hire me."
fru,"but Maybe they don't want to hire me because they know me. I don't know, what's wrong with me, Is there something wrong with me?"
fru,"I mean, You can tell me what.  Why is no one hiring me?  Is it me?  Be honest.  You can tell me. you know I can take it.  I can take it, you just tell me. Why?"
fru,"Yeah, but I'm -- okay, well how about personality wise?  I mean, people who know me won't hire me.  Why?"
ang,An abrasive vibe?
ang,"Let me know that's -- that's fine.  You think I have an abrasive vibe, whatever.  You're entitled to your opinion, of course.  Maybe that's why I don't have a job."
fru,"I'm not like this all the time.  I mean, I don't -- I'm just frustrated right now, all right.  I just want to do --"
fru,"I want to make some money.  I need to make some money.  I've got to pay some bills, I owe people money.  I owe lots of people money.  I need to make some money."
fru,"Do you have any idea how I can make money?  I mean, what can I do to make some quick money, something?  Anything, that's relatively within the you know law."
fru,"Right, probably not selling pot. I don't want to go to jail."
fru,Because that would just really be a topper for me.
fru,Thank you.  Ha ha.
fru,See what I mean?  You can't even think of anything.
fru,I can juggle.
fru,I've tried.
fru,Yes!  Nobody wants a juggler.  I am not going to -- I'm not going to dress up like a clown. I'm not going to dress up like a freaking clown. No.
fru,"No, it's demeaning.  I am not a clown.  I have talent.  Clowns don't have talent."
fru,It's that simple.
fru,yeah.
fru,You and me both.
fru,"No, I just showed that for you [garbage]."
fru,I like to think so.
fru,see.
ang,"Yeah, well thanks for your help."
sad,I'll need it.
neu,Hmm. Hmm.
neu,How long ago was that?
neu,Uh-Hmm.
neu,"Um, okay.  Well, you can fly- file a claim.  Where were you coming from?"
neu,"So, within the country, though? umm"
neu,"Yeah, well the chances of it being lost forever, you know, are slight because -- -- you were in the --"
neu,"Well, I mean, you know that happens pretty often that sometimes baggage -- -- gets lost."
neu,yeah.
neu,Okay.
neu,Did you have insurance on your flight?
neu,"No, you have to buy it now.  It's like thirty dollar extra."
neu,"well, it's something that worth"
neu,"yeah, I don't know."
neu,Chances are it's probably just you know -- taking time being um- unloaded from the airplane.
neu,"Um, well, there's not much I can do.  I can, you can file this report and we'll call you when it comes in."
neu,wow.
neu,"Wow.  Well, that's really important, obviously.  But, um --"
neu,"Uh- Actually, I don't know that that's legal. Um- it is the issue"
neu,"Yeah I mean, Your bag might have been confiscated because it's --"
neu,-- it's a biohazard. so- um
neu,Yeah.  Let me just call security.
neu,[LAUGHTER] Okay.  Hold on.
neu,Hi. Um-  My luggage didn't come out of the conveyor thingy.
neu,"So, um, what do I do?"
neu,"Uh- Like, an hour and a half ago.  I talked to somebody who was standing out there and they said wait.  Sometimes like random butt- pieces come out late."
neu,"And so I waited there, but nothing came."
neu,"I was coming from um the Midwest, like Iowa."
neu,"Yeah, I know I was in the country.  I mean, it's not that complicated."
neu,"Well, I would hope so."
neu,People lose --
neu,"You know, this is actually, I mean it's -- it's a really important piece of luggage."
neu,"I mean, it's not big or anything like that.  I mean, it's not worth a lot of money or anything."
fru,"Well, no one even told me about that.  Like, why would I think to buy insurance?  I was- It's like a three hour flight."
fru,"How can you lose my luggage like from like, in --"
fru,"I should hope so.  You know, I need that today."
fru,"Let me explain to you what the problem is.  My grandfather's remains are in that bag.  And I have to, like, distribute them today.  We're suppose to, you know, throw them out to the sea today."
fru,"Yeah.  I mean, if you have a suggestion, like, it would be great to help me out here."
fru,"Well, I don't care if it's legal.  It's happened.  It's already done."
fru,"Well, could you tell me if it's been confiscated then."
fru,"I mean, some information here would be great.  Some help.  Can you, like, type something in and find out?"
fru,That would be great.  Thank you very much.
neu,Thank you
sad,"Oh, I'm so sorry"
sad,"Oh, my gosh."
sad,What did he do?
sad,Yeah.  I'm so sorry.
sad,You guys have been-
sad,I'm sorry. I-
sad,"Wow, Ryan I know that you are hurting right now but I don't think you always feel like that."
sad,Yeah. I understand.  I think it's really healthy to grieve.
sad,If there's anything I can do to be there for you.
sad,I just got some bad news.
sad,"My friend, Shotty, passed away."
sad,"The end, he's been sick for awhile.  He had cancer."
sad,"Yeah.  It's just, I never thought it would actually happen, you know? I mean- He's such a fighter and he's always so positive about everything."
sad,"You know, he was gonna, and we -- all the way up to the end we were just talking about how- you know all the stuff we were gonna do and, you know.  When he finally kicked this stupid cancer, you know, and we were gonna --"
sad,"he wanted to travel, you know.  And he's so talented.  Probably the most talented person I have ever met in my entire life."
sad,"He was a designer, you know.  But he did everything. You know, He painted and he- and he did costume design, he did set design, he did lighting, he was --"
sad,"he just did everything.  He was literally, literally the most talented guy I have ever met in my entire life."
sad,And he's gone now and I  -- I just can't believe it.
sad,"I mean, one second you think, you know, you're just having a conversation and then --"
sad,"you know, sometimes you think you want to make that phone call, or you think you want to tell somebody something, or something like that.  Do you know what I mean?  Like that's -- he was the person that I did that with.  You know, like, that's the person who I needed to call to tell things to all the time."
sad,"And now I don't have that person anymore, you know.  And it's -- -- it's just, you."
sad,"You think that things get easier, you know, as you as you get older and you -"
sad,"and it just gets worse.  It just gets worse, everything is bad all the time; people die, your friends die, family dies, your best friends die. it's-"
sad,"You always think, you know when you were- you know when you were a little kid and you think something is gonna happen, like, it will all be better when I am older, you know?"
sad,"No, you're right.  I don't.  You're right."
sad,"Even, yeah -- he doesn't he would never feel that way, he would never want me to feel that way.  Of course not, but that's just where I am right now and -- -- I don't know what else to do with it."
sad,I just miss him.
sad,Thanks.
exc,What?
exc,"Oh, for real?"
exc,"oh,I'm so glad."
hap,What are you gonna study?
hap,Really? Are you doing the M.F.A. program?
hap,I heard it's so tough to get into.
hap,That's awesome.
exc,"Yeah, that's awesome."
neu,No.
exc,"Uh huh.  Yes, seriously, for years."
exc,I know.  I know.  I'm- I'm definitely -- I realize [LAUGHTER].
hap,"Um- I'm gonna be studying at U.S.C., too."
exc,Yeah.  Totally- Well where are you going to live?
neu,Oh yeah.
neu,Good tradeoff
neu,I don't- I don't think it's that bad.
neu,yeah.
neu,"Yeah. I think it's really also if you- if you consider yourself like, us and them, kind of thing- If you think you're part of your community then --you going to like it more"
exc,"Right, Exactly."
exc,Oh I'm so glad.
hap,"So when do you know, like, where you're gonna live? and-"
neu,"Oh, wow."
neu,Um-
neu,"Yeah.  I mean, I know, I know, like the- the housing surrounding the campus pretty well."
neu,Um- How many people do you want to live with?
neu,All dudes?
neu,Um- I think I have some friends.
neu,yeah.
hap,"There's actually, a friend of mine is um- moving out of her place and her place is amazing-- And it's really cheap."
neu,yeah.
neu,Okay.
hap,"You've got a lot- oh, awesome."
hap,Oh cool.
exc,Yeah.
neu,totally.
hap,good for you.
neu,the way to do it.
exc,"Wow, are you so excited?"
exc,"You're gonna be so busy, too. You're going to have to work so hard."
exc,All right.  Wow.  So exciting.
hap,Yeah.  We'll have so much fun.
exc,Guess what?
exc,I got it.  I got accepted to U.S.C..
exc,Yes! I just found out today.  I just got the letter.
exc,I know. I know.  I'm so excited.
exc,"oh, Theater. yeah, yeah."
exc,yes.
exc,oh-
exc,It's exactly what I wanted.
hap,"I worked really hard, I'll say, I worked really hard. You know, I I'm not bragging or anything like that. But-"
exc,"Finally.  I'm so excited.  We're gonna -- well, I'll be here.  We're still gonna be able to see each other."
exc,"What are you, wait, what are you doing?"
exc,"Perfect!  Oh, my God.  Are you staying, are you going to live on campus?"
exc,We are gonna have a great time.
exc,"[garbage] I'm going to live on campus.  I mean, well, around campus, anyway.  Yeah, housing around campus."
exc,"I just want to be really close to things, you know.  I know it's not exactly the best neighborhood in the entire world. But uh-"
exc,"I don't- you know ,I feel the same way, you know what I mean.  And everybody says a lot of other crap you know, they don't know what they are talking about anyway."
exc,"They don't live here.  They don't know, right?"
exc,yeah.
exc,Exactly.  You make it what you make it. You know? Right? And I'm gonna make it so freaking awesome.
exc,yeah.
exc,"Well, I don't know.  I've got to go look for a place."
exc,"Yeah, yeah.  I- I don't- I don't know.  Do you have any suggestions?"
exc,You know the area better than I do.
exc,"Not a lot.  I mean, I wouldn't want to live with more than three other people.  So, like four of us total, right?"
exc,I don't care. I don't care.
exc,yeah?
exc,That would be perfect.
exc,Really?
exc,Really?
exc,Cheap is exactly what I need- Because I have no money at all.
exc,"But, uh--"
exc,"Loans, scholarships, I've got a lot of scholarships-- Yeah, yeah. I'm- I'm half Native American so I get all those scholarships, too. yeah."
exc,"So it comes Indian like. And you know I'm kind of smart, so."
hap,"And yeah, well, I mean, basically I just applied for any and every possible scholarship and grant that could come by, so I can go."
exc,"Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And it's gonna work out.  I'm gonna be able to pay for it, I'm gonna go, I mean, I'll have a little debt in the end.  But I don't care."
exc,It's just you know a dream come true.  How could you not be excited about a dream come true?
exc,"Oh I know, I know."
exc,"But I'm so looking forward to being so busy. You know what I mean?  It's the kind of busy you've got to love, right?"
exc,Because you're doing something you love.  That's the kind of busy you want.  I want to be able to do that for the rest of my life.  Be that kind of busy.
exc,I had to tell you right away.  I knew you'd be excited.
hap,We'll have fun.
exc,Great.  Okay.
fru,"Hi, I need- I need some help.  I've been transferred to, like, eight different departments and I've told my problem to every single department, and then they just send me to another one and say they are going to send all my information so I won't have to repeat it, and then that person doesn't know what's going on.  And I've restated my story about eight different times and I just want somebody to help me get my connection back, because this happens every two weeks.  And I want to know what to do to stop it from happening again."
fru,Yeah.  That my service just goes out.
fru,yeah.
fru,"And I'll reset the IP address.  I will do like, you know, direct connect the modem to my computer, and then reset everything, and then put the router back in. And-"
fru,"Is not, It it It will work again for like a week and then it goes out again."
neu,"Uh, yeah.  We've pinned it a couple of times."
neu,"Pretty much, yeah - I don't know if it's, like, bad phone lines or something."
neu,Hmm. Mmm.
neu,yeah.
neu,"It goes- It goes, like, through doorways.  But it goes a long distance."
neu,"Well, I- I can check that.  Is there anything else we can do, too?  Like, I'll go through and check the line throughout the house, but --"
neu,Uh huh.
neu,All right.
neu,"Yeah, I see that."
neu,Okay.
neu,Okay.
neu,"Uh, it it's like a bunch of different letter and numbers and stuff."
neu,"Uh huh, Okay."
neu,"Uh, yeah looks -- no, no.  It's set to zeros."
hap,"Oh, my God.  I can't even tell you how much of a relief that is.  I literally call and talk to five different people.  Like last week it went off and I spent an hour and a half on the phone with different people.  And I've been doing that like every, every other week for months now."
fru,It's so frustrating.
hap,"Yeah, accountability.  It's awesome."
hap,"Wow.  You know I was thinking about changing internet providers, but but that- that really is enough to change my mind."
hap,No.  I'm just gonna go have a fantastic day now.
hap,Okay.  Thanks.
neu,"D.S.L. Extreme, can I help you?"
neu,This happens every two weeks?
neu,You've lost your connection.
neu,okay.
neu,Hmm.  Mmm.
neu,Has somebody tried to pin your site?
neu,"Okay. Um-  Well, I don't know.  And it consistently happens every two weeks?"
neu,"Well, you know what, does your D.S.L. cable -- you have D.S.L., right?"
neu,"Okay.  Does your D.S.L. cable, you know, travel a long distance by any chance? - Does it go through any windows?  I mean, is it --"
neu,"Okay.  Is it being- Is it being compressed between anything by any chance?  Because sometimes your connection can be you know, disrupted by, you know, the cable being squished."
neu,"Yeah. That can be- That can create a bad connection.  And it won't always be a bad connection, but it will be bad off and on."
neu,"Yeah, well, absolutely.  What we can -- let's just go ahead and just do a basic diagnostic of your system first off, okay.  Can you go down to your start button?"
neu,"Okay, And uh- go ahead and click on run."
neu,Okay.  We're gonna get your -- a little black box is going to come up.  Do you see that?
neu,"Okay Uh- You've got your C calling, go ahead and type in directory list."
neu,And hit enter.
neu,Okay?  Can you tell me what that says?
neu,"Okay Okay, And Um- letters and numbers and stuff.  Uh- Can you - Can you just type in IP address search? And hit enter."
neu,Okay?  Does it list your IP address there?
neu,"It's set to zeros.  Okay, maybe that's our problem.  That could very well be our problem there.  Somehow you've lost your IP address.  I'm not sure why that would happen every week.  It could be a cycling issue, something like that.  But let's go ahead and type your IP address in again."
neu,"Well, if it does happen again, let me give you my direct number and you can call me.  Actually, I'll give you my cell number. Um- It's --"
neu,"Of course.  we seriously- Yeah, I mean, obviously you've worked- you know -- I don't want to hassle you anymore."
neu,I completely understand.
neu,Absolutely. And I just don't want that to happen to you anymore.
neu,Absolutely.  It's a new service we are offering.
neu,Uh huh Uh huh We want you to be happy.  You're our customer.  You're the most important thing. Okay?
hap,"Great.  Well, that makes me very happy.  That makes us all happy here at D.S.L. Extreme.  Is there anything else I can help you with?"
neu,All right.  You have a wonderful day.  Call us anytime.
hap,"All right.  Bye, bye."
sad,What's he going to say?  Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.
sad,When?  I was the first one up.  He was still in bed.  How could he have seen it?
sad,Did you talk to him?
sad,He cried hard?
fru,"What do you want to do, argue with him?"
fru,how are you gonna prove it?  Can you prove it?
fru,"To you it is and to me, but not to him.  Now you can talk yourself until you're blue in the face, Chris, but there's no body and there's no grave.  So where are you?"
ang,"The trouble is the God damn newspapers.  I mean every every week a kid turns up, missing like longer than Larry."
ang,"Well, what do you want me to do?  You're old enough to make- to know your own mind."
fru,I'm just saying.
ang,"I ignore what I got to ignore.  I mean, the girl is Larry's girl."
ang,"From your father's point of view he's not dead and she's still his girl.  Now, you can go on from there if you know where to go, Chris, but I don't know.  So what can I do for you?"
neu,"Well, you're a considerate fella, there's nothing wrong in that"
neu,Have you asked Annie yet?
neu,"Well, what if she feels like your father?  And how do you know she will marry you?"
neu,"Well, the trouble is you never saw enough women."
fru,"Well, I just don't see why it has to be Annie."
fru,"Well, that's a good reason.  But that doesn't mean anything at all.  I mean, you haven't seen her in five years."
fru,"No.  I don't want a -- look, your father thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl and you're pronouncing him dead.  Now, what's going to happen to your father; do you know?  Because, I don't."
ang,Are you crazy?
ang,"All right.  But don't think like that.  Because what the hell did we work for, Chris?  I mean, this whole thing, it's all for you."
ang,Just don't think that way.  Do you hear me?
fru,"I don't understand you, do I?"
fru,"Yeah, I can see that."
sad,No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.
fru,You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?
fru,I don't want to argue with him.  But it's time he knows that nobody else thinks that Larry's alive anymore.
ang,"Why should he dream about him, walking around looking for him at night?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore, that we haven't had any hope for years now?"
fru,We have to say it to him.
ang,For Gods sake!  Three years!  Nobody comes back after three years.  That's insane!
fru,"All right.  All right, mom.  Just listen.  You know why I invited Annie her, don't you?"
neu,You know.
neu,I'm going to ask her to marry me.
fru,It's not just my business.
fru,So it's okay then?  I should just go ahead and do it?
ang,"Oh, so it isn't just my business?"
ang,You infuriate me sometimes.  Do you know that?  God.
ang,"Isn't it your business, too, if dad -- if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it?  I mean, you have such a talent for ignoring things."
ang,She is not Larry's girl!
fru,"I don't know why it is but everytime I reach out for something I- that I want, I have to pull back because I might hurt somebody else.  My whole bloody life; time after time after time."
ang,To hell with that!
ang,So what?  I'm not fast with women.
fru,Because it is.
fru,"I know her best, all right?  I don't know.  I grew up next to her.  When I think of somebody for my wife these days, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?"
ang,"I've given it three years of thought.  I hoped that if I'd waited, dad would have forgotten about it by now.  And we could have like a normal wedding and everybody happy."
ang,"But if that can't happen, I'll just have to get out."
ang,"I'll get out.  I'll go get married and live someplace else.  I don't know, maybe New York."
ang,I have been a good son for too long.  A good sucker.  I'm through with it.
ang,"Yes.  On this, I would."
ang,"Well, you help me stay here."
fru,"I know that, mom.  Just, you help me stay here."
fru,"No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy."
sad,What's he going to say?  Maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it.
fru,"The trouble is the God damn newspapers, I mean, ea- each week a new boy turns up out of nowhere.  So the next one is gonna be Larry.  So you--"
fru,"What do you want me to do?  I mean, You're old enough to know your own mind."
fru,"I ignore what I got to ignore.  I mean, the girl is Larry's girl."
neu,Have you asked Annie yet?
neu,"Well, how do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels like your father does."
neu,The trouble is you don't see enough women.  You never did.
neu,"Well, that's a good reason.  But it don't mean a thing. I mean, You haven't seen her since you went to war.  It's been five years."
fru,"No I don't want a-  Your father thinks he's coming back, Chris.  If you marry that girl, you're pronouncing him dead."
sad,"Now, what's going to happen to your father, do you know?  I don't."
ang,Are you crazy?
ang,Must you be inspired?
ang,You don't want to think like that.
fru,"All right.  But don't think like that because what the hell did we work for, Chris?  All of this, all of it, it's all just for you."
fru,"I don't understand you, do I?"
sad,He was out here when it broke.
sad,About four this morning.  I heard it crack and I looked out the window and he was standing right there when it cracked.
sad,"I don't know.  But after he saw it, he ran back into the house and started crying in the kitchen."
sad,No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.
sad,"Yes, yes he is.  I don't know the meaning in it.  But I know one thing, mom, we made a terrible mistake with Dad."
fru,I don't want to argue with him.  But it's time that he knows that nobody else believes that Larry's alive. I mean
fru,"Why shouldn't he dream about him, walk the nights waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say outright that we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had any hope for a long time?"
fru,"For Gods sake, three years!  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane!"
fru,"All right.  All right, just listen."
fru,You know it's not just my business.
fru,So it's all right then?  I should just go ahead with it?
ang,"Isn't it your business, too, if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it?  You have such a talent for ignoring things."
ang,She's not Larry's girl.
fru,"I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something that I want, I have to pull back because it might hurt somebody else, my whole bloody life, time after time, after time."
ang,what to hell with that!
fru,"I'll find out and then we'll thrash it out with dad, all right?  Mom, don't avoid me."
fru,"So what, I'm not fast with women?"
fru,Because it is.
fru,"[garbage] I don't know.  It's just,"
fru,"she's who I know best. I know her since I- I was a kid I grew up with her.  When I think of somebody for my wife these days, I I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?"
fru,"All right then, mom."
ang,"I've given it three years of thought.  I had hoped if I waited, dad would've forgotten him by now and we could have a- a regular wedding and everybody happy."
ang,But if that can't happen then I'll just get out.
ang,"I'll get out.  I'll go get married someplace else, I- I'll live someplace else, maybe New York."
ang,The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.
ang,"Yeah, I'd like one hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, I'd like to go home to something beautiful.  I'd like a family.  I'd like some kids."
fru,"I know that, mom.  Just you help me stay here."
ang,"Well, I am thinking like that."
ang,"No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy."
neu,Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.
neu,He's got that about it.
ang,"What's going on here, Joe?"
fru,"I want you to pretend like he's coming back.  Both of you, don't think I haven't noticed you and Chris since she's gotten here.  I don't want any nonsense."
fru,"No, because if she- he's not coming back then I'll kill myself. Laugh!  Laugh at me!"
fru,Only last week a man turned up in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  You read it yourself.
ang,You above all have got to believe.
ang,I can't help it.
neu,Why does that bother you?
neu,"Well, maybe maybe he just wanted to see her again."
fru,"What are you talking about?  He grew up next to the girl his whole life, why wouldn't he want to see her again?  Don't look at me like that.  He hasn't told me anything he didn't told you."
neu,Why do you think he's even thinking that?
fru,"Well, so what?"
fru,Now listen.
fru,How do you know why she's waited?
fru,"Look, it's a beautiful day outside, why are we arguing?"
fru,"Well, what do you want me to do about it?  What do you want?"
fru,But Kate?
fru,Calm yourself.
fru,Calm yourself.
fru,All right.  All right.
ang,"What's that suppose to mean, me above all?  Look at you, you're shaking."
ang,"What have I got to hide, Kate?  What the hell is the matter with you?"
neu,You're the only one I know who loves his parents.
hap,It's all right.  It's a good thing.  It's lovely here.  The air is sweet.
neu,"Well, your mother, first of all, pretty much told me to leave."
neu,"I figured they would, your mother at least."
neu,"Well, from her perspective, I mean, why else would I come here?"
hap,"Oh, Chris I've been ready for a long time."
sad,I almost got married two years ago.
hap,Everyday since.
exc,"Well, I mean, until then you never wrote and when you did, what did you say?  I mean, you sure can be ambiguous."
exc,Not like that you're not.
sad,"Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  What's the matter?"
sad,Even in your letters there was something ashamed.
sad,You have to tell me.
sad,It wouldn't work like this.
neu,"Yeah, sure."
sad,How many?
sad,Do you still feel like that?
sad,"Because you can't feel like that anymore, Chris.  Because everything you have, you have a right to, me included."
hap,[LAUGHTER] What will I do with a fortune?
exc,"So, you're not sorry I came?"
neu,Well-
exc,"You feel it's wrong here, don't you; this yard, this chair?  I want you to be ready for me, Annie. I- I don't want to win you away from anything."
hap,You felt something that far back?
exc,"oh, God I kissed Annie.  I kissed Annie. I can't How long have I waited to do that?"
exc,"Oh, Annie, we're gonna live now.  I'm going to make you so happy."
sad,Lets go for a ride.  I I- I want to be alone with you.
sad,"No, nothing like that."
sad,"Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going for me."
neu,I don't I don't know where to start.
sad,It's so mixed up with so many other things.
sad,I lost them.
sad,Just about all.
sad,"It- It takes time to toss something like that off,I mean, because they weren't just men."
sad,I know it's it's just a little thing but that's just the kind of guys I had.  They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.
sad,"I mean that exactly, anymore selfish -- just a little bit more selfish and they would have been here today. And it gave me an idea as I was watching them all go down."
sad,It was and then I went home.  And it was incredible.  It didn't have any meaning there.
sad,"I felt what you said, ashamed somehow because nobody had changed at all."
fru,"It seemed to make suckers out of so many guys.  And I-I felt wrong to be alive; to to open that bank book, to to drive that car, the new car, and look at that new refrigerator. I mean,"
fru,"you can take those things out of the war, but if you're gonna drive that car you've got to know that that came from the love a man can have from a man. And you've got to be a little bit better because of that.  Because if you're not, then it's all just loot and there's blood on it and I didn't want any of it."
sad,And I guess that included you.
sad,"I want you now, Annie."
exc,"Oh, Annie,"
hap,Annie I am going to make you a fortune.
sad,Fine.
neu,What flashlight?
fru,Pass what up?  It's It's just little fish and they swim up on the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.
fru,"What are you so excited about.  This isn't rocket science, this is just fish.  Fish nobody even eats."
fru,Augie.
sad,I'm just not.
fru,"Well, if you also remember last year we- our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, we had a big argument, you had a sore throat, and we didn't see the grunion."
fru,We didn't see them the first time either.
exc,"What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.  Oh, this is great, isn't it?  Look at the night we've got here.  It couldn't be better.  Actually, I wanted to go a little further up the coast you know to get away from all the lights and the people.  I was afraid we might miss it though, so how are you doing?"
exc,"What's that? Is that- Wait, is that foam?  I can't even tell.  Oh Actually, I guess if I can't tell then it probably isn't it, is it?  It will probably be unmistakable, don't you think?"
exc,"This is great.  How are you doing?  Oh, no.  Oh, do you know what I did?  I forgot the flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I forgot the flashlight."
exc,"The flashlight.  The silver one.  There's only one, isn't there?  Stupid."
exc,"Oh, no, of course, our flashlight.  Me flashlight is to you flashlight, naturally."
exc,"How could we have forgotten it? Well, I hope the moon stays out.  I wonder, do they always run during a full moon?  I can't remember, was the moon full last year, do you remember?"
exc,"Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket.  Oh, this is great.  I didn't even think to bring a six pack.  Oh, a six pack would be just the ticket right about now."
exc,"I can't believe I forgot.I'm like a little kid.  I'm surprised I made it out of the house with my fly zipped. Oh, [LAUGHTER]"
exc,"Oh, I wonder if they can hear me or if they can feel the vibrations when we move around in the sand. or something"
exc,Do you want my jacket?
fru,Oh
exc,"Honey, it's a natural phenomenon.  I mean, this kind of thing only happens once a year.  It's a great opportunity."
exc,"I mean, Think about people in Kansas, they've got to get like you know plane tickets and hotel reservations just to see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's just too good of an opportunity to pass up."
exc,"Yeah, but all that time on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  You know,"
exc,"and all that about flopping around, it's like laying eggs or what do you -- spawning or mating or something like that."
exc,"I mean, this is a big night for these guys.  You know, life's last orgy."
fru,"Yeah, they do."
exc,"All right.  But they are fish that do something no other fish do.  Like the swallows were turning into Capistrano or Lemmings jumping off the cliffs, you know like that. There's- There's magic here and mystery.  And a little bit of the unexplainable.  You know, I can't see how you could not be interested."
fru,For real?
fru,"I don't get it.  I mean, the first time we came you said it was the best night of your life. And last year I remember distinctly you were so excited about coming that you stubbed your toe toe pushing me out the door and you didn't even notice until you got in the car."
exc,"Look there.  What is that?  Is that -- Oh No, that's seaweed."
exc,"Oh, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for the world. I mean, think about this, I know you're not interested but just think about this for a second;"
exc,somewhere out there is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction.  They don't know why they're doing it.  We don't know why they're doing it.  They didn't- It wasn't a decision.  No one took a vote.  Nobody sent them an invitation or a map or anything like that.  It was just some internal time release fire cracker that went off. And all as one they turned around and formed this giant line as long as the California coastline and they just started swimming.  They are swimming right now at this very moment.   And And-
exc,"And it's single mindedness with no mind. It- It's urgency, it's pure urge.  I mean, they didn't make any decisions.  They don't ask any questions.  They don't give it a name,"
exc,"they just all as one turn around and start swimming to this very point where we are standing now for one last celebration of sex and death. God, it's giving me Goosebumps.  Look at all the hairs that are standing up."
exc,"Well, so what do you think?"
neu,About what?
neu,It's ridiculous.
fru,"I'm sorry.  It's just, it's it's just fish to me."
ang,"God damn it, Augie.  Seriously, you always ask me that.  Why do you ask me that?  I hate it.  It's so insulting."
fru,I just - We just have different ideas of what this night is suppose to look like.
fru,We We don't ever.  Have we ever?
ang,"Twice is every time we've tried, that's ever"
ang,"No, we won't.  It's like waiting up for Santa Clause or something.  I feel like as though my whole life is going to be standing on the beach waiting with my eyes opened expectantly, my hands clasped neatly in front of me, waiting for fish to show up.  And the fish will not show up."
fru,You don't understand anything I am saying.
sad,I did want to see it.  I always want to see it.  I just- I keep thinking this will be the time and it never is.
sad,Do you remember the first time that we came to see the grunion?  It was about four years ago right after we got married.  We thought I was pregnant.  We had a bottle of champagne and no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  We took off our shoes.  And while we were dancing you said the most intimate things to me right in my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them.
sad,"And I remember thinking to myself, finally.  I am as happy as I am supposed to be."
sad,"Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle."
sad,I would rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for something.
sad,No.
sad,No.
sad,No.
sad,No.
sad,I just want- I just want things to turn out the way they are supposed to.
sad,But this isn't at all what I wanted it to be.
sad,"This is just this.  I mean, it's a lot and everything.  But it's not, you know, something else.  Am I making any sense?"
sad,"I know that, Augie.  I do.  I know that. And and I know that this meant a lot to you and and it's special, you know, with the sand and the moon but."
sad,But I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.
sad,I didn't say that.
sad,"For heavens sake, Augie, whatever I am doing, I'd rather it be with you."
sad,"Yes.  Don't you know that? I mean, You're probably the one you wishes you were with somebody else, somebody who didn't take everything so hard and who knew how to enjoy herself."
hap,"Yes, I did notice that.  It does look really beautiful over the water.  Big old white moon."
hap,"No.  I'm beginning to think you might be right. I think  this might be the spot after all.  Augie, I'm sorry."
hap,Or not.
exc,"Well, so, what do you think?"
exc,What I was just saying.
fru,It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.
neu,"uh, Carla Can I ask you a question?  no, don't get upset, but are you having your period?"
fru,What's bugging you then?
fru,"It's not that complicated.  We come down here, the grunions arrive, they do their little fish thing.  We say ooh, awe, look at the little fish.  And then they go home and we go home."
fru,We've missed them twice.  That's hardly ever.
fru,"Okey, They're just fish.  It's nothing to get traumatized over."
fru,"No, of course not."
fru,"I'm trying to work this backwards.  But I can't seem to pinpoint the time where everything went wrong here.  Okay, so --"
fru,"you were fine on the phone call with Marge, eating dinner was fine,talking- uh washing the dishes, no problem.  All right.  So, I'm taking a shower, you're watching TV, the news and you say the grunions are running tonight and I say, Great, let's go.  I'm feeling lucky.  And so, all right, and I'm putting on my coat, I'm putting out the animals, I'm pulling the car out of the garage."
neu,"It was in the car, right?  When we were passing Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, Let's stop and get champagne. and I said that times a wasting or something like that, right?  You wanted it to be like it was before, right?"
fru,"What, you want me to blow in your ear?"
fru,"Do you want to get married again?- What?  What, do you want a divorce?"
fru,A vacation?
fru,"A poodle, a backrub, a spa, a suicide pack?  What, Carla, what the hell do you want?"
ang,"Well, welcome to the human race.  Do you think this is what I had planned?  Do you think that when I proposed that I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we would end up arguing on the beach over some fish?"
ang,"Do you think that I thought there would be times when you would look at me like I was used Kleenex or I would look at you and think, good God, when's the next flight to Alaska?  No.  No, I'm just like you. I thought it would all be like peaches and roses, and sand in our toes, and wind in our hair, and the fish would always come.  And the bills would magically pay themselves.  And we'd have three fat rosy kids.  But, ha ha, baby, the jokes on us!"
ang,"Because you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This."
fru,Right.
sad,"Now, I know.  Me either"
sad,I'm trying the best I can.
sad,"Maybe if you're with somebody else, too?"
sad,"No, I know.  But I know I don't make you happy."
hap,"Actually, now that you mention it, no.  I don't."
hap,"I don't know.  I think this is a pretty good spot.  I mean, look at the view of the moon from here."
hap,"Oh, well look what we've got here."
hap,"Well, it isn't champagne."
hap,Or not.
exc,"what, Nobody knows we are here except Freda and she wouldn't ring up."
exc,What do we do?
exc,"Now and always, my sweet."
exc,It was bound to happen sooner or later.
exc,"Oh, it sent shivers up my spine."
neu,Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious.
neu,Who's they?
neu,"If I laugh at everything, then I must laugh at us too."
neu,"Well, will we always bicker and fight?"
neu,"What if one of us dies, does the other one laugh then?"
neu,"Elliott, worms don't pop."
exc,I know you did.  You threw it out the window into the Canal below.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.
exc,"Oh, It burnt my comb and all the towels in the bathroom."
neu,You knew there was nothing in that.
exc,I wonder.
neu,"We're all right, aren't we, darling, whatever happens?"
exc,I don't care then.
exc,"Oh, what shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us."
exc,With the worst- with the most perfect poise?
exc,"Uhh, It's amazing how once you feel--"
exc,"things that ought to matter most dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy, do they?"
exc,"Uhh, You mustn't say that, my darling."
exc,"Being that sacred and wonderful thing, love."
exc,"Um What does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my endless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?"
exc,"You mustn't be serious, darling.  That's just what they want."
exc,"All the futile mortals who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them, Be flippant.  Laugh at everything, all their sacred shibboleths."
exc,uh- the- Being flippant brings out the acid in their damned beauty and light.
exc,Certainly you must.  We are figures of fun all right.
exc,No.  That fire will fade along with our passion.
exc,"Yes, yes, with all his might."
exc,"No, no that is quit laughable.  The cutting little mystery all done with mirrors."
exc,"So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as long as we can, like little quiet idiotic school children."
exc,"[garbage] Darling, kiss me before your body rots and worms start popping in and out of your eye sockets."
exc,"I don't care what you do.  See, you could paint your body bright green and and run naked through the Place Vendome and run with every man in the world and I shan't say a word.  As long as I know that you love me best."
exc,Do you remember that awful scene we had in Venice?
exc,The one where you bought that little painted wooden stake and you put it on my bed.
exc,Horrible thing.  I hated it.
exc,How long did that roue last?
exc,"Oh, The worst one was in Cannes when your curling iron burnt a hole in my new dressing gown?"
exc,"[LAUGHTER] That was quit a rouser, wasn't it?"
exc,"Oh, I didn't hit you very hard."
exc,I should never forget his face. [LAUGHTER]
exc,We were very much younger then.
neu,Only a trivial little broach.
neu,Not at all.  I quite like it.  I wear it often.
fru,"[garbage], No, I didn't.  You worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination."
neu,"Oh, maybe a little.  Nothing serious."
neu,"Well, what of it."
neu,Well it gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't hurt me.
fru,I'm getting very bored with this conversation.
neu,No thanks.
neu,It's becoming a habit with you.
fru,Don't be stupid.
neu,Just making myself fascinating for you.
ang,"No, it isn't."
ang,"No, it it is not, be quiet."
fru,They sting.
neu,"Yes, I did quite a lot."
fru,You're quite insufferable.  I do imagine it's because you're drunk.
neu,You always had a weak head.
ang,Not- Would you shut up.
fru,"You're not very funny, dear.  You better have some more brandy."
ang,Very well.  If you have to be boorish and idiotic.
ang,You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.
ang,Go away!  Go away!  I- I hate you.
ang,"You know what, I'm sick and tire of listening to you.  You're a-- You're a total sadistic bully."
ang,"Stop.  Would you just go away?  I mean, you're conceited, and overbearing, and utterly impossible."
ang,This is the end! Do you understand me? This is the end.
ang,"Yes, I am. Let go with me"
ang,"You are a cruel fiend and I-I loath you.  I thank God I realized who you are before I decided to marry you again.  Oh my God, never!"
ang,Beast
ang,Brute
ang,pig
fru,You must admit that he was in love with you. wasn't he?
fru,He let him kiss you.  You said you did.
ang,"Well, that's a nice point of view I must say."
ang,"Me, too, bored stiff."
neu,Do you want some brandy?
neu,I think I'll have a little.
ang,"Amanda, really."
fru,"Nothing.  Are you going out somewhere, darling?"
fru,"Um- Well, that reply has just broken my heart."
ang,It's a pity you didn't have a little bit more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.
fru,"Nonsense, they've got a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap!"
ang,They snap.
neu,"So, did you see much of Peter Burden after the divorce?"
ang,"You must have let him kiss you quite a good deal more then, huh?"
ang,"I'm sure you had a riotous time, no restrain at all, very enjoyable.  You never had much anyway."
ang,I am not the slightest bit drunk.
ang,I do believe that I have said already that I had three minuet liquor glasses of brandy in the entire evening.  A child of two couldn't get drunk of that.
ang,"Oh, really?  How about a child of three, or child of six, what about a child of nine?"
ang,"You know, we could get a really good debate going on about this.  You know intemperate tots."
ang,You know what?  That's a very good idea.  I think I will.
ang,"You better turn that off, I think."
ang,Because it's very late and you'll disturb the people upstairs.
ang,"Well, there are people downstairs, I suppose."
ang,This is no time of the year for Tunis.
ang,I do I shall do no such thing.
ang,Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.
ang,Turn it off!
ang,Very amusing indeed.
ang,Ja! Very funny.
ang,"You are a vile tempered, wicked living, evil little beast.  And I hope I never set eyes on you ever again."
ang,"Oh, you're not going like this."
ang,"[GARBAGE] No, you're not."
ang,oh! Marry you again? I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on bended knee.
ang,You're a wicked little vampire.  And I pray to God I never set eyes on you again as long as I live.
