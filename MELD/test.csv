133,"Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.",0
134,"You're not? See, that's why you're so great!",2
135,"Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic.",0
136,"Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me!",3
137,Define me!,3
138,"Love me, I need love!",3

154,Okay!,1
156,Bye!,0
157,Bye!,0
158,Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!,3
159,"Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?",0
161,"Listen uh, I'd prefer it if you didn't call me Joey.",0
162,"Since I don't know anyone here, I thought it'd be cool to try out a cool work nickname.",0
163,"Hey, dragon! Here's your tips from Monday and Tuesday.",0
164,There's like-there's like 300 bucks in this one!,2
165,"Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.",0
167,Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight's specials?,0
168,"Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag....Why is nobody writing these down?",0
169,Because we can remember them.,0
170,Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?,3
171,Hey. When you guys were kids and you played,0
172,I was always Joanne.,0

176,Don't look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel!,5
177,"Wait! Wait! I wanna see this. After I divorce him, half of that kingdom is gonna be mine.",1
178,What a wank!,3
179,"Oh, I cannot believe he's using our divorce to sell mattresses.",3
180,I know!,3
181,"And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves.",3
182,And I'm appalled for you by the way.,3
183,"You had to do it, didn't you? You couldn't just leave it alone.",4
184,Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there's a bug in my food.,5
185,"Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along.  Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.",3
186,"Yeah, I'm gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.",5
187,"Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?",0
188,"I'm, I'm freaking out!",6
189,Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldn't have!,6
190,"All right, I haven't lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something.",0
191,Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?,0
192,Um. yeah.,0
193,I am,0
194,"All right, look, here's the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay.",0
195,"So, I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.",0
196,"Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn't work.",3
197,"Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that's why you have got to be the bigger man here.",0
198,"Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn't make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say ‘Like me!",3
199,Like me tiny doctor!',3
200,"Okay, well can't you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?",4
201,"Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we're never gonna get along.",3
202,"Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay.",3
203,"Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don't wanna have to have a separate room for you too!",3
205,"Okay, okay, okay.  I'll get the bagels.",0
206,"Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?",0
207,"All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.",0
208,"Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.",0
209,Really? A purse?,2
210,It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.,3
211,It looks like a women's purse.,0
212,"No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look.  See look,",0
213,"See look,",0

217,"Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.",0

220,Here you go.,0
221,"You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who.",0
224,"no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me, I don't think either answer would make me feel better.",4

1265,Count it off.,0
1266,So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not?,0

1277,"Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldn't invite her?",6
1278,"Oh, no-no, y'know I absolutely adore Rachel it's just that, well it might be a awkward for you.",4

1393,"Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sister's beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way.",0
1394,"Although, I should probably tell you, she's a porn star.",0
1395,"Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think you're chances are pretty good.",0
1396,All right.,0
1397,"As bad as that went, I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I'm going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.",0
1398,Why don't you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn't have to apologize.,0
1399,I would really love it if I could do both.,0
1400,"All right, I…I have to ask.",4
1401,What?,0

1407,"Here's Frannie. Hmm, won't she be happy to see me?",1
1408,"Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didn't bring you here so you can ambush her.",3
1409,Frannie was the one who found your,0
1410,That bitch!,3
1411,Monica! What,2
1412,Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!,3
1413,"Hi Frannie, congratulations.",0
1414,"You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?!",3
1415,Why?!,2
1416,What....Why wouldn't you want me at your wedding?,3
1417,What could I have possibly done?!,3
1418,Stuart!,3
1419,I believe you know my husband.,0
1420,So it's really a question of,0

1428,"Man to uh, me.",0
1429,Sure. Okay.,0
1430,"Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!",2
1431,"Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy.",0
1432,You mean scared.,0
1433,"No, I mean happy.",0
1434,"Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.",1
1435,"Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica's and she and Chandler had a big fight and they're not moving in.",4
1436,"What do you mean, they're not moving in? They-they're still moving in right?",2
1437,"No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.",0
1438,What?! Over a stupid room!,2
1439,"Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I'm also really psyched ‘cause I don't have to move in here!",1
1440,"Oh no, yeah no, that part's great!",1
1442,Shut-out!!,2
1443,"Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!",2
1444,"Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!",4
1445,"Yeah, get out!",3

1448,"Come on, wussies!",3
1449,"All right, ok, I gotta go.",0
1450,"I'm going,  and I'm gone.",0

1454,Ohhh. Don't go.,4
1455,"No, I-I-I gotta go.",4
1456,No. No! No! No!,4
1457,"Honey, honey, people are looking.",4
1458,I don't care!  I don't care!!,3
1459,"Yeah, um, I'm, I'm leaving now.",4
1460,You can't leave! I have your shoe!,4
1461,Good-bye Chandler Bing.,4
1462,Rachel has those in burgendy.,0
1463,"Oh, ew!",5
1464,What?,0
1465,Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you.,0
1466,"Um, can you roll your tongue?",0
1467,"Because I can, and my Mom couldn't, and I thought y'know, I figured that was something I got from our Dad.",0
1468,"What, wait, you mean like this?",0
1469,"Yeah, yeah. You can do it to.",2
1470,Your not doing it.,0
1471,"Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I can't. We don't have that....",0
1472,Where there is no fear of commitment.,0
1473,Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?,0
1474,"Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right.",0
1475,"But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear.",0
1476,"It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building!",6
1477,If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug.,0
1478,Right.,0
1479,"In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.",0
1480,"Amazingly, that makes sense.",1
1481,You think?,0
1482,"Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!",1
1483,"Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.",6
1484,Hey!  Hey!,1
1485,Hi!,1
1486,Hi! Look! I got our pictures developed from Rockefeller Center.,1
1487,"Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona ice skating?",1
1488,"Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now.",0
1489,Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?,0
1490,"Oh yeah, probably at the end.  Oh my God! He only took pictures of my breasts!",2
1491,I'm missin' picture time?!,1
1492,Y'know she has a face Ross!,3
1493,"Okay. Okay, here's a good one of us.",1
1494,Wow!,1
1495,That is a good one!,1
1496,"Wow, it looks like a, like a holiday card y'know, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.",1
1497,"Y'know, every year I say I'm gonna send out holiday cards and I never do it.",0
1498,"Do you wanna, do you wanna send this one out together?",0
1499,Together? Like-like to people?,2
1500,"Yeah, y'know. Happy holidays from Mona and Ross. It'll be cute, okay?",1
1501,Okay.,1
1502,"Oh, I gotta get to work. So call me later?",0
1503,"Uh sure, sure.",0
1504,Bye guys.,0
1505,"I mean, I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.",3
1506,You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you've got a girlfriend?,3
1507,Is this about Mark?,0
1508,Oh my God.,2
1509,"Okay, it's not, it's not.",0
1510,"Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.",4
1511,"Fine, you're right.",0
1512,"Let's ah, let's take a break,  let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yoghurt, or something..",0
1513,No. A break from us.,4
1514,"Bing! We're all set for tonight, 8 o'clock.",1
1515,"Oh uh, as it turns out, we can't do it. Monica has to work.",1
1516,"Oh, my ex-wife didn't work, unless you call turning into her mother work. Fine. Tomorrow night then.",0
1517,Oh uh well tomorrow's no good for her either.,0
1518,Oh? Why not?,0
1519,It's the semi-finals…of her…botchy ball tournament.,0
1520,"What's going on Bing? Does uh, your wife have a problem with me or something?",3
1521,Well now-now you're just talking crazy.,1
1522,So why can't the three of us go out together?,0
1523,Because uh…we-we…we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.,4
1524,"Good God Bing I…well I can't say I'm altogether surprised, I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there.",4
1525,"And the way she looked at me, pure lust.",1
1526,Y'know what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?,3
1527,"Bing my boy, we're gonna get you over this.",0
1528,"Now here's the plan, grab your coat, we're going to a strip club.",1
1529,"Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak.  But to hell with that bitch.",3
1530,"Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel...    with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya.",0
1531,"It's    okay, Emma, you stay asleep.",0
1532,": Step away from the crib,    I have a weapon!",3
1533,"It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.",0
1534,What are you doing?,0
1535,"Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could    reach Hugsy.",0
1536,"Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go    to the bathroom.",0
1537,There you go sweetie...     This isn't over.,0
1538,Did he call?,0
1539,No. Sorry.,4
1540,Why?! Why?! He said he'd call. Why hasn't he called?,4
1541,"Maybe he's intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.",0
1542,"Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasn't he called, Rachel? Why?",3
1543,"Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.",0
1544,Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?,2
1546,"The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didn't tell him not to call me, did you?",3
1548,"Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that.",3
1549,And you're upset because you didn't make your best friend cry?,4
1550,"I mean, all I'm asking for is just a little emotion!",3
1551,Is that too much to ask after six years?!,3
1552,I mean what?,3
1553,Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?!,3
1554,I mean do we not have as much fun?!,3
1555,Don't I deserve a few tears?!!,4
1556,"I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!",4
1557,Hey!,3
1558,I did not cry my eyes out!!,3
1559,Come on!,4
1560,It's like the end of an era!,4
1561,No more J-man and Channie's!,4
1563,"Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!",3
1564,Do I know why we're rushing?,0
1565,"Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night?",0
1566,"Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me.",0
1567,"Oh, I found it!",1
1569,That's so great for you guys!,1
1571,"Good luck, with your girlfriend.",0
1572,"Oh, thank you.  Hey, hey.  Rachel!!!!",1
1573,"Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.",0
1574,"Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.",0
1575,So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?,0
1576,"Yes, you can, very much.",1
1577,Ahhhh!!,2
1578,"Ooh! I'm sorry! I think, I THINK, that may have missed the table!",1
1579,Do,0
1580,"Ah,",0
1581,Do,0
1582,"Ah,",0
1583,DO YOU?,3
1584,Y'know I don't understand why they didn't cry. It was a beautiful speech.,4
1585,"Oh, come on.",5
1586,Hey!,4
1587,"All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad!",1
1588,And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin.,0
1589,And what you said about Nana.,0
1590,"Ohh, yeah she really would've wanted to be there.",4
1591,And you know what?,0
1592,I think she was.,0
1593,"Oh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it?",2
1594,You forget how many great songs Heart had.,0
1595,Yeah.,0
1596,"You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.",0
1597,"So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.",0
1598,"Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I'm not even sure I got it.",0
1599,"What, you didn't get it? The doctor is a monkey.",0
1600,And monkeys can't write out prescriptions.,0
1601,You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.,3
1602,"Your joke? Well, I think ‘the Hef' would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.",0
1603,I can't find garbage bags!,3

1982,"Well, I just called Joshua",0
1983,"Oh, how did it go?",4
1984,"Well, I did my best to convince him that I'm not some crazy girl who is dying to get married....I'm just going through a hard time.",0
1985,What did he say?,0
1986,"Well uh, his answering machine was",4
1987,"Ohh, sweetie!  Hey, I bet you anything that he's gonna call you again.",4
1988,"Yeah, maybe, but I don't think I even care.",4
1989,I don't think he's the one I'm sad about.,4
1990,"Y'know, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don't think I'm handling it all that well.",4
1991,"Yeah, maybe.",4
1992,And I-I am just trying to figure out why.,4
1993,Any luck?,4
1994,"Well, yeah, y'know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again?",4
1995,"I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.",4
1996,Again. Y'know what? I think we all did.,4
1997,Hey!,1
1998,I don't get it!,2
1999,It was in my room all night!,3
2000,"And if she didn't take it, and I didn't take it; and you  didn't take it, then who did?",3
2001,Shh!,3
2002,We're trying to think!,3
2003,"This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.",0
2004,What?!,2
2005,Oh yeah!,1
2006,I got in there myself once.,0
2007,"My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn't, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in.",0
2008,Yeah.,0
2009,It was funny ‘til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.,0
2010,"No, you, you can't fit in that thing. That's not deep enough.",0
2011,"Oh yeah?  If I can't, I'll knock five bucks off the price off the unit.",3
2012,"All right, you have yourself a deal.",0
2013,Okay.  See?! I told ya!,2
2014,"Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!",3
2015,Hey! What's up?,0
2016,Hey!,1
2017,"Hey-hey, who's your friend?  Hey!!",1

2022,"Ohh, listen. I've got to get going. Today was great, thanks!",1

2024,"Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just",0
2025,Really?!,2
2026,Ohh!,2

2037,This woman's living my life.,3
2038,What?,2
2039,"She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me!",3
2040,"Look at this, look.",3
2041,She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see.,3
2042,"She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people.",3
2043,She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.,3
2044,You're not an artist.,0
2045,"Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.",3
2046,I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.,2
2047,"No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.",3
2048,"I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.",0
2049,Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!,6
2050,I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!,2
2051,"Oh, that is so sick.",5
2052,I feel violated. And not in a good way.,5
2053,"How can people do that?...  Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!",2
2054,Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around?,1
2055,"Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.",0
2056,I know. My arm is killing me.,0
2057,"No, I meant with the dropper over here.",0
2058,"Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm",3

2073,"What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.",4
2074,Hey.,0

2076,What's the matter?,0
2077,Nothing.,0
2078,What is it? Hey!,4
2079,Really it's nothing. I'm just,4
2080,"Rach come on, what?",0
2081,I've just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.,4
2082,What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?,2
2083,"Oh please, he'll be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs.",4
2084,"Okay, how long was I watching that woman?",0
2085,"I'm just saying that y'know, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody and…he's gonna have his own life. Right?",4
2086,"Yeah, I guess so.",0
2087,I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?,4
2088,Bob. Bob! Bob!!!  What the hell are you doing?!,2
2089,"I just found out this is Chandler's office! Come on Toby, give me a hand!",1
2090,"Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.",3
2091,We said seven!,3
2092,We said six!,3
2093,"The only way that I said six would be if the seven's, let meet at seven, not at six.",0
2094,"Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would've said something like this, ""Wow! My boyfriend's such a wise ass....seven!""",3
2095,Hi!,1
2096,Oh my good God.,5
2098,I know what time you said.,1

2100,"Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.",0

2109,"Y'know you, really didn't have to take me to the airport.",0
2110,Oh please.,0
2111,Every moment is precious.,4
2112,Y'know?,0
2113,"Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don't really seem to care too much that you're leaving.",4
2114,"Well, we're really not that close.  Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.",0
2115,"On no! No! It's not good-bye, I'm not leaving until you get on that plane.",4
2116,"No, I'm afraid I won't be able to make love as well as him.",3
2117,"Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.",0
2118,"Yes, and I was saying the actual words.",0
2119,"So big deal, so Joey's had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn't mean he's great in bed.",0
2120,"We share a wall! So either he's great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.",0
2121,"Sweetie, with you it's gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, ‘cause you-you guys are in love.",1
2122,Yeah?,2
2123,Yeah!,1
2124,Just go for it Chandler.,0
2125,"Yeah, you should.",0
2126,"Yeah, you should, really.",0
2128,"All right, all right, I'll go sleep with my girlfriend. But I'm just doing it for you guys.",0
2129,": I'm sure as hell a dancer, it's no use Marge will never go for me.",4
2130,"Come on Treeger, don't say that.",4
2131,"You just ahh, you just need more practice.",0
2132,"Here, come on, let's ahh, let's try it again.",0
2134,"Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway.",4
2135,"I mean, y'know, I'm not really that comfortable dancing with a.... We-he!!",1
2136,Hey!,1
2137,: Yeah!,1
2139,Are you sure? I'll bet there's another flight to Minsk in like,0
2140,"July. Umm,",0
2141,That's really beautiful. What does it mean?,1
2142,"Please, clean my beakers. I don't get out of the lab much.",0
2143,"That's good. I got to admit, I thought it was something else.",1
2144,"Yeah, I… Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, I figured I probably shouldn't because y'know, I…have to leave.",0
2145,You're right! You're right. Don't say it.,4
2146,I-I do though.,4
2147,I do too.,4
2148,Bye Phoebe.,0
2149,"Okay, now's not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.",4
2154,"Yeah, I-I heard.  I think it's great!  Ohh, I'm so happy for you!",1
2157,I can't believe you're getting married!,1
2158,Yeah.,0
2159,Monica and Rachel made out.,0
2160,Ohhh!,2
2161,Why are we in bed together?,2
2162,I don't know. Do-do you have any clothes on?,0
2163,Yeah.,0
2164,Really?!,2
2165,No!,0
2166,"But we-we didn't have…sex-uh, did we?",6
2167,"I mean, I don't remember much about last night, it was such a blur.",0
2168,Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.,1
2169,And we didn't have sex.,0
2170,"Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I'm just glad we didn't do anything stupid.",0
2171,Tell me about it.,0
2172,What are we gonna do?,0
2173,I say we go with,0
2174,Chandler?,0
2175,Did she see us yet? Did she see us?,0

2182,"Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.",0
2183,"Yeah, I know...  ..I'm I'm just not that bright either.",4
2184,"Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing.",0
2185,Y'know what? It,0
2186,Sorry.,0
2187,I'm so exited!,1

2190,I got new sheets!,1
2191,I'm making him a,1
2193,What am I making him by the way?,0
2194,"Well, you're making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.",0
2195,I thought I was making him filet mignon?,2
2196,"Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant.",0
2197,"And then you realised if you  bitched about it, then you  would stop cooking, and you  would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.",3
2198,"Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.",2
2199,"Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don't worry about it!",4
2200,"I'm not worried, I'm uh, I'm fascinated.",6
2201,"Y'know it's like uh, Biology!",0
2202,"Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me.",6
2203,"Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay.",0
2204,Phoebe!,1
2205,"If you would've let me finish, it goes on to say that he's probably not gay.",0
2206,You are falling fast asleep.,0
2207,Deeper.,0
2208,Deeper.,0
2209,Deeper.,0
2210,You are now completely asleep.,0
2211,You don't need to smoke.,0
2212,Cigarettes don't control you.,0
2213,"You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.",0
2214,"A strong, confident woman.",0
2215,"Thank you for your patience, you're the next caller.",0
2216,Yes!! Yes!! I'm the next caller! You were gonna have me hang up.,1
2217,Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?,0
2218,Of course not.,4
2219,No.,0
2220,Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.,0
2221,So how are things going with Paul?,0
2222,Good.,1
2223,"Although y'know, he-he's a private guy.",0
2224,"Y'know, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.",4
2225,That's easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won't open.,0
2226,So what are you saying.  I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?,2
2227,No that's what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.,0
2228,Hi honey.,0
2229,Hi!,1
2230,"Okay, Ben, I won't tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you don't tell about our little bonking incident.",6
2231,"Monica, number one, I don't think Ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, I...   What?!",2
2232,You said number two.,0
2233,I also said number one.,0
2234,Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.,0
2235,Can't I just look at the handles on them?,0
2236,You would think.,0
2237,"Okay, fine.",0
2238,"Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why I'm a terrible waitress?",3
2239,"Because, I don't care.",0
2240,I don't care.,0
2241,"I don't care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don't care where the tray spot is, I just don't care, this is not what I want to do.",3
2242,So I don't think I should do it anymore.,4
2243,I'm gonna give you my weeks notice.,4
2244,What?!,2
2245,"Gunther, I quit.",4
2246,Does this mean we're gonna have to start paying for coffee?,2
2247,"Ohh, I mean it's just so realistic!",1
2248,"I know.  Yeah, his name is Pat.",0
2249,Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!!,1

2251,"Oh, I probably shouldn't....so I will!  Oh! Wow! It's like it's raining!",2
2252,"Pretty cool, huh?",1
2253,"But if you're thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn't get sucked up into the mechanism, well you'd be wrong.",0
2254,"Umm, can I use your bathroom?",0
2255,"It's uh, right through there.",0
2256,"Okay.  God y'know, if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbiani's apartment",1
2257,"Yeah, life's pretty great isn't it?",1
2259,"You know, I think I was sixteen.",0
2260,"Please, just a little bit off the back.",0
2261,"I'm still on ""no.""",0
2262,"Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?",0
2263,"No-no-no-no-no,  I'm not fallin' for that again.",3
2264,What's goin' on?,0
2265,"Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.",0
2266,What stupid thing did you do?,0
2267,Ewww!,5

2269,"See, yes.",0
2270,"That's Yasmine Bleeth, she's a completely different kind of chick.",0
2271,I love you both.,0
2272,But in very different ways.,0
2273,Hey!,2
2274,Hey!,2
2276,"I did! But the store wouldn't take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?",3
2277,"If they can't find a home for her, they kill her! And I'm not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!",3
2278,"Okay, good, good, good, ‘cause, good, ‘cause I was kinda having second thoughts too.",6
2279,Okay. And it's not just chicks y'know? It's all kinds of other animals!,5
2280,"That's horrible! Well, you did the right thing man.",5
2281,"Thanks, I'm glad you see it that way.",1
2282,"Ohhh-hoo, funny story!",1
2283,"So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?",0
2284,"Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.",0
2285,"So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?",0
2286,"Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.",0
2287,"Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.",0
2288,I don't care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!,1
2289,Really?! That's what you heard?  You said that?,2
2290,I might've said that.  Why is that funny?,0
2291,Because I'm very happy for him!  And,1
2292,Hi!,4
2297,Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment?,3
2298,"Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!",5
2299,Fish!,2
2300,"It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.",0
2301,"Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here",4
2302,"Oh, it's so much more fun with you.",1
2303,"We did have fun, didn't we?",1

2331,"Ohh, that's a good one.",1
2332,"OK, try this salmon mousse.",0
2333,Mmmm. Good.,1
2334,Is it better than the other salmon mousse?,0
2335,It's creamier.,0
2336,"Yeah, well, is that",0
2337,"I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?",5
2338,My God! What happened to you?,2
2339,"Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn?",5
2340,"""You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation.""",3
2341,That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!,1
2342,"Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really",3
2343,"Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!",4
2344,"Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.",1
2345,"Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.",0
2346,I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.,0
2347,"Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!",4
2348,"Sweetie, you think you can get in there?",0
2349,I don't see why not.,0
2350,Here's my retainer!,0
2351,Someone in there?,0

2379,I-I-I'm leaving the show?,2
2380,I don't know. Why? Did you hear something?,0
2381,Who told you that?,2
2382,"Oh uh, one of the writers.",4
2383,Which one? Was it bald or was it tall?,2

2392,"Y'know, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?",2
2393,I don't think so.,0

2395,Wow!,2
2396,Yeah.,0
2397,Really?!,2
2399,$4.50 please.,0

2742,"Yeah, I'm not in that.",0
2743,"I know, but look at me: all tan.",1
2744,"Hey, why don't you guys go get portraits done by a professional photographer.",0
2745,That's a good idea! I bet they have one of those wind machines! Y'know,1
2746,"Yeah that's great! Next to that, Chandler won't look so stupid.",0

2756,"Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?",3
2757,Well,0
