2449,And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!,0
2450,"I didn't even think about that!  Aaargh,",3
2451,"Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something.",0
2452,"Ok, that'll be great!",1
2453,"Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.",5
2454,That's not what we're gonna do!,5
2455,"Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?",5
2456,"Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.",1
2457,Hello Skidmark.,0
2458,"It's a nickname, I'll explain later.",0
2459,It's pretty clear.,0
2460,"Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.",0
2461,That's why you broke up with me?,2
2462,"You-you-you didn't know that.  Well, I guess my work here is done!",4
2489,Ni-chou chi-ma!,1
2490,"Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....",2
2491,Hi everyone.,0
2492,"I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk before.",0
2494,"Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.",0
2495,"What did, what did he say?",6
2496,"Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know.",0
2497,"So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so.",0
2463,"Oh, great!",1
2464,"We couldn't keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while y'know, he'd kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck.",1
2465,"Okay, stop it Phoebe, you're getting me all tingly.",1
2466,"All I could think of was y'know, ""Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?""",1
2467,And did he?,0
2468,"I'm a lady Monica, I don't kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself.",1
2469,"Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.",0
2470,I just like him so much that I just feel like I've had 10 drinks today and I've only had six.,1
2471,"Oh, I haven't had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler.",1
2472,"Wow, I'm never gonna have that feeling again, am I?",4
2473,You sound like a guy.,5
2474,"No, a guy would be saying, ""I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else.""",5
2475,Oh my God!,2
2476,I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else!,4
2477,I've been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that I'd be giving up!,2
2478,"I mean, I…I'm never gonna have a first kiss again.",4
2479,You'll have a last kiss.,0
2480,Thank you so much for coming back over.,1
2481,"Oh good, you're here. Yeah, and I was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable.",4
2482,"I know Mona, just hear me out.",0
2483,"First of all, I'm so sorry about my father yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own.",0
2484,You're gonna have to tell me how you did that.,0
2485,Focus.,0
2486,"Okay. Um…But....Okay, yes Ross and I used to date. And yes we are gonna have a baby. But we are",0
2487,All right where's that turkey!,0
2488,Joey! Those are my maternity pants!,2
2489,Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!,1
2490,No.,0
2491,No!,3
2494,"Oh, would you look at that Monica?",1
2495,"I just knocked off all of your top scores, how sad.",1
2496,"Okay, I'm next.  Don't! Don't start another game! I said I'm next! Phoebe!",3
2497,"Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't hear you over all the winning.",1
2498,Chandler! Phoebe's hogging the game!,3
2499,Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?,0
2500,Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.,0
2501,"Anyway, it just doesn't seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? It's a lot of work.",0
2502,But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving!,1
2503,"I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie!",4
2504,Or Friday with no two pizzas!,4
2505,All right fine! If it means that much to you! But just....there's gonna be a ton left over.,4
2506,No there won't! I promise I will finish that turkey!,1
2507,"All right, you're telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?",0
2508,That's right!,1
2509,‘Cause I'm a Tribbiani!,1
2510,And this is what we do!,0
2512,We can eat!,1
2514,"Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.",2
2515,Look at this!,1
2516,Oh! You have a window!,2
2517,Yes indeedy!  With a beautiful view of...,1
2518,Oh look! That guy's peeing!,2
2519,Hi.,0
2520,Hi.,0
2521,"Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too?",3
2523,Okay. Let's use this brush.,0
2524,Okay. This stuff?,0
2525,Yeah.,0
2526,All right.,0
2527,"Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid. Okay? Just sweep it.",0
2528,Okay-Dokey,4
2529,Where exactly is your zoo?,0
2530,"Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience.",0
2531,"Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?",0
2532,Yes.,0
2533,"Does he, uh, fight with other animals?",0
2534,"No-no, he's, he's very docile.",0
2535,Even if he were... cornered?,0
2536,"Well I, I don't know. Why?",0
2537,"Uh, how is he at handling small objects?",0
2538,"He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...",0
2539,"How about a hammer, or a small blade?",0
2542,Otherwise it's just cruel.,0
2543,"He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.",1
2544,"We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...",0
2545,...He's in.,0
2546,"He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!",1
2547,You're making a big mistake here.,5
2548,"I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains.",0
2549,My specimen is in the    room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there.,0
2550,Really helped speed the process along!,1
2551,Janice!,2
2552,You're not... gone?,2
2554,Sid is still in his room.,0
2555,I don't allow porn at home so    this is like a vacation for him.,1
2556,So did you do it?,2
2557,Did you make your deposit?,0
2558,Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!,1
2559,"That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes    next, I mean aren't you worried about the results?",6
2560,I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet...    I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.,1
2561,"Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is.",0
2562,"Phoebe, where's your purse?",6
2563,"No, no! Give it to me!",3
2564,You can't have it.,3
2565,Give it to me!,3
2566,No,3
2567,I'll go in there.,3
2568,Oh yeah.,3
2569,Phoebe come here,0
2570,Haha!,1
2571,Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!,3
2572,"What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial.",5
2573,I just had sex.,0
2574,"Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?",2
2575,"Well, you never told me how old you were.",0
2576,"Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?",5
2577,I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'...,1
2578,Don't say it.,6
2579,...in love with you.,1
2580,Really?,2
2581,Sorry.,4
2582,"Well,fall out of it.",3
2583,"You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night.",3
2584,"Oh god, oh god.",1
2585,I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad.,5
2586,I'm Joan Collins.,5
2587,Who?,0
2588,"That's right, still no baby!  Come on people! Please make some room!",4
2589,"Uh sweetie, maybe you'd be more comfortable here?",0
2590,You. Like you haven't done enough.,3
2591,"Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do.",0
2592,I mean I wish I were a seahorse.,0
2593,"Because with seahorses it's the male, they carry the babies.",0
2594,"And then also umm, I'd be far away in the sea.",3
2595,God.  I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!,1
2596,"Oh I know, I've been there. I remember toward the end",0
2597,"Oh Phoebe, that's a great story.",0
2598,Can you tell it to me when you're getting me some iced tea?,4

2627,"She's avoiding me, she doesn't want to tell me where my Father is.",4
2628,"She knows, and she won't tell me.",4
2629,"Aww Pheebs, that sucks!",4
2630,"Yeah, well, don't “Aww Pheebs, that sucks!” me yet.",4

2643,"All right, stop it. Now you're just doing it to freak me out.",4
2644,"Ok, you can do this.",0
2645,It's just like pulling off a Band-aid.,0
2646,"Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.",0
2647,"Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.",4

2651,Go for it.,0
2652,"Phoebe, I'm engaged!",2
2653,"I'm just saying, get his number just in case.",0
2654,But no: Chandler is in an accident and can't perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.,0
2655,"Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, I'm engaged.",1
2656,Well you should be embarrassed.,5
2657,"I did, but that was really fun.",1

2668,She'd-she'd love this.,0
2669,"Uh, it's an exact replica of Apollo 8.",0
2670,I made it in the sixth grade.,0
2671,"Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.",0
2672,"Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn't actually land on the moon.",0
2673,"But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely.",1
2674,"Wait a minute, I can't give this to her.",0
2675,Why not?,0
2676,"Because it says ""Captain Ross"" on the side and ""I hate Monica"" on the bottom.",0
2681,Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!,3
2682,He might still show up.,0
2683,"Oh, what are you, stupid? It's been three hours.",3

2717,I can't figure this out!,3
2718,It's so hard!,4
2719,Should I get her a  Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a....ah-ah!,4
2720,Paper cut!,4
2721,"Now, have you told anyone else?",0
2722,"No, I don't want to tell anybody else because I don't want Monica to find out.",0
2723,You told me.,2
2724,"Well, it's because I trust you, you're one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.",3
2725,"Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadn't been on the toilet.",2
2726,Me too.,0
2727,Hey.,0

2746,"I wake up this morning, the stripper's gone and the ring is gone!",6
2747,You slept with the stripper?,2
2748,Of course!!,6
2749,What difference does that make?!,3
2750,"Well, I'm just....if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!",3
2751,"Joey, do you have a minute?",0
2752,"Dude, what am I gonna",6
2753,"Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out.",3

2756,"Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have",0

2760,"Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!",3
2761,"I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone!",5
2762,What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?,2
2763,And you're not supposed to be gossiping!!,5
2764,"I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phone",6
2765,I'm not listening to you!,3
2766,Oh! Yay! Look! There's a piece that doesn't have floor on it!,1
2768,"Hey, come on now!",3
2769,"All right, what are we havin'?",0
2770,"Uhh, I don't believe in these crazy diets y'know, just everything in moderation.",0
2771,I'll take those to go.  For the kids.,0
2772,"Oh, I know what I wanted to ask you. You were on the show years ago and then they killed you off. What happened there?",0
2773,"It was so stupid, I said some stuff in an interview that I shouldn't have said.",3
2774,"But believe me, that's not gonna happen today.",0
2775,"Understood. So, what'd you say back then?",0
2776,"Well, I said that I",0
2777,Ha!,0
2778,So you like the drums!,1

2786,"Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?",2
2787,Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.,4
2788,I'm gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.,3
2789,"Joey, please don't do that. I think it's best that we just forget about it.",6
2790,"That's easy for you to say, you weren't almost just killed.",3
2791,"All right that's it, school is in session!",0
2792,My God! Is this a gym card?,2
2793,"Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I've missed the last 1200 times.",0
2794,So why don't you quit?,0
2795,You don't think I've tried? You think I,1
2796,Who is Maria?,0
2797,"Oh Maria. You can't say no to her, she's like this lycra spandex covered gym…treat.",1
2798,You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?,0
2799,No!,3
2800,So you're strong enough to face her on your own?,0
2801,"Oh no, you'll have to come.",6
2805,"Pheebs, I don't think anyone's mad about that.",0
2806,Exactly! Because it's in the past!,3
2807,Anybody gonna eat that?,0
2808,Pheebs!,1
2809,Hey!,1
2810,"Listen, you know how uh, when you're wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?",0
2811,Yeah!,0
2812,"Well, when Jake did it I saw that…he was wearing women's underwear!",2
2813,I know. They were mine.,0
2814,"Oh.  No! No wait, that's weird!",5
2815,"No, it's not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.",0
2816,That's weird!,5
2817,I'm wearing his briefs right now.,0
2818,That's…kinda hot.,2
2819,I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.,1
2820,"Yeah, I wouldn't know about that.",0

4421,"It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes.",2
4422,"I know it's a little sudden, and it's a little rushed, and it's totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn't mean I can't.",1
4423,Right?,1
4424,"I mean I'm-I'm crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.",1

4431,He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.,0
4432,Wow!,2
4433,"Yeah, well he'd prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.",0
4434,"So then, are you going to dump Jason?",0
4435,"Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and… Okay so Jason is sensitive,  but now so's Vince  Plus, Vince has the body y'know?",0

4461,"I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?",0
4462,"I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.",6
4463,Really? Me?,2
4465,"Oh my god, are you kidding?",2
4466,"Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't.",3
4467,"Well, you're not totally paranoid.",0
4468,Oy.,1
4469,"Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.",4
4470,"Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?",0
4471,"Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.",1

4567,"No, I know! I get it! It's funny!",1
4568,"No, because you're not a grandmother!",4

4608,"Oh, that's very....Really very-very okay.",0

5196,Aren't you with that girl over there?,0
5197,"Well, yeah, kinda.",0
5198,"Um, but that's okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people,  so I'm allowed to sleep with you.",0
5199,"No, no, no, it's flattery.",1
5201,"Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella.",1
5202,"Don't, don't just dismiss this so fast.",6
5203,I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...,0
5204,"Yeah, for you. Is that the list?",0
5205,"Um, yeah.",0

5211,"Um, see, but that's not the final draft.",0
5212,It's laminated!,3
5213,"Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler  brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local.",0
5214,Y'know it's ironic...,0
5216,...because I have a list of five goofy coffee house guys and yesterday I bumped you for that guy over there.,0
5217,We're just gonna be friends.,0

5228,"Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot!",0
5229,"Ohh! And I'm one of them!! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!",2
5230,"Well, y'know it's none of my business, but aren't you married?",0
5231,Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit! Y'know I just wish we could be like on a break!,3
5232,Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!,3
5233,So that's the only reason she could be here huh?,0
5234,It couldn't have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I'm a good listener and I uh I put on a,0
5235,"Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!",3
5237,"I think I can take care of myself, I'll talk to you later.",0
5238,Good-bye.,0
5239,Whoa!,2
5240,"Uh, that was your sister actually.",0
5241,She-she thinks that you're just using me.,0

5246,What?!,2
5247,"Umm, okay, okay, look.",0

5249,"Okay, because I know that this is my Father.",3
5250,"Yeah, this is Frank Buffay and you are standing right there next to him.",3
5251,"Now, look I deserve to know where I came from.",3
5252,All right?,3
5253,So if you can help me find my Father then you should!,3
5254,"Otherwise, you're just mean!",3
5255,"So, just tell me the truth!",3
5256,"All right, the man in the picture is Chuck Magioni.",0
5257,My Father is Chuck Magioni?,2
5258,"No, no, that's just Chuck Magioni, I-I sold him a house last year!",0
5259,"And I'm very sorry, but I don't know where your Father is, and that's the truth.",4
5260,Oh.,4
5261,"But umm, you're right.",0
5262,I think that a person should know where they come from.,0
5263,"Wh-which is why I ah,  ahh,  okay.",0
5264,I'm your mother.,0
5265,Heh?,2
5266,"Y'know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just, I kinda felt all floopy, and...",4
5267,What's happening to your accent?,2
5268,Come again?,2
5269,What's-what's this nonsense?,6
5270,"All right, I'm-I'm not English.",4

5272,"I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out.",4
5273,I'm sorry.,4
5274,"So, if we could just get back to the lecture.",0
5275,"Umm, were there any questions?",0
5276,About paleontology.,0
5277,"All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression.",3
5278,"Obviously, I screwed up.",4
5279,But what you guys think of me is really important because I'm-I'm hoping to get a permanent job here.,0
5280,So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression,0
5281,Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am,3
5282,"Well, hello Rachel!",2
5283,"Where you going, Joe?",0
5284,For a walk.,0
5285,Oh. You mind if I join you?,0
5286,"Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize    my thoughts.",0
5287,Your thoughts? Plural?,2
5288,"Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny,    I gotta see her!",1
5289,"I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.",0
5290,Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her??,3
5291,You guys are killing me!,4
5292,She's forbidden fruit!,4
5293,"It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable    boy ... Why are you doing this, huh?",4
5294,Did Ross tell you not to let me go over    there?,0
5295,"Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.",0
5296,Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against    the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.,3
5297,Great novels?,2
5298,Fine ... mediocre porn,0
5299,"Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but we're gonna have to get into Mr. Zelner's office.",0
5300,"Now, he doesn't get in until 10, so he's no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.",0
5301,That's kinda sad.,4
5302,"Yeah, well Betty is kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates.  Now, while I distract her,",0
5303,Got it!,1
5304,Let's roll!,1
5305,"Hello Rachel, you uh, got a minute?",0
5306,"Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anything....minute. Okay. Fine.  Abort the plan, abort the plan.",0
5307,"Uh actually, I'd like to speak with both of you.",0
5308,"Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates?",0
5309,"Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?",0
5310,Yeah! Thank you so much for letting me stay here.,0
5311,Oh! No problem! I,1
5312,What?,2
5313,You are iron.,0
5314,You are steel!,1
5315,"Let me ask you something, how come when I call your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half?",3
5316,"I told you, we're adding new operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training?",0
5317,"I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!",2
5318,"Look, you and I went to different high schools...",0
5319,"Okay, that doesn't help me, because we went to the same high school.",0
5320,"You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip's motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket.",0
5321,I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.,4
5322,They had to have that specially made?!,2
5323,It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.,0
5324,"Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!",2
5325,"Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he's-he's called me up and asked me out.",2
5326,And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go.,1
5327,I-I owe her this.,0
5328,I never let her eat.,0
5329,"Oh, you go out with him.",0
5330,"Oh, really?!",2
5331,"Yeah. Just, if it's possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?",0
5332,I'll try.,0
5333,"Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that you're dancing with.",0
5334,"Yeah, yeah, okay.",0
5335,"Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown – I'm trying to win her over, so I was wondering if..",1
5336,"Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, she's real, uh, mellow!",3
5337,"Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know",0
5338,"Ross, get over it! It's not like she hates you.",3
5339,Yeah but,4
5340,"Ross, she's not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.",0
5341,Huh. Y'know what's not one of a kind? A twin!,3
5345,"Ooh, Phoebe's here! Okay, let's turn out all the lights and we'll just watch the movie!",1
5346,"Okay. Hey....Ooh, cool sheets!",1
5347,"Oh, you like it? You wanna know where I got it?",1

5361,"Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.",5
5363,"I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?",4
5364,"So honey, this morning was fun, huh? Me hopping in on you in the shower there.",1
5365,Yeah! And maybe someday we could get a place with two bathrooms.,1
5366,"Look Carol umm, I was, I was thinking maybe uh, maybe we can spice things up a little.",0

5532,What do I do?,2
5533,"Well, the delivery went out to you and I realized they forgot this.",0
5534,"Ah, must've been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left in your store.",0
5535,"Listen, to be honest, home deliveries are really a part of my job description.",0
5536,Oh.,0

5543,Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.,1
5544,Really?! I-I thought you weren't looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.,2
5545,"Well, y'know, possibly.  You didn't tell him that, though? Right?",6
5546,"Ummmmmmmm, no.",0
5547,You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don't tell the guy that!,3
5549,"Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first date....oh, he's so gonna get the wrong idea.",4
5550,"Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.",0
5551,"Oh, yeah. Had that dream.",0
5552,"Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.",2

5568,"Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate.",0
5569,"So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is.",1
5570,"Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?",0
5571,Oh my god.,2
5572,What?,2

5574,"Come on, they're close.",0
5575,Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.,5
5576,"Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.",0
5577,"Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it's....not really true, is it?",5
5578,"Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...",0
5579,"Oh my god, what were you thinking?",5
5580,"All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.",0
5581,Oh!,2
5582,Ow!,2
5583,I'm outta here.,5

5984,You're good. You're good!,1
5985,"Yeah, no, I'm fairly intuitive and psychic. It's a substantial gift.",0
5986,"Listen, can you promise me that you won't tell her though?",6
5987,"Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?",0
5988,Thanks a lot.,0
5989,"No I'm serious. I mean I'm intuitive, but my memory sucks.",0
5990,"Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi.",0
5991,"For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!",3
5992,"Oh, hey, hey, I got that.",0
5993,"Oh, thanks, sweetie.",1
5994,No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.,1
5995,Really?,2

5998,"No, no, they will. I just... uh...",0
5999,Can't wait.,0
6000,Do I know you?,2
6001,"Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been?",2
6002,"Good, good, I'm a lawyer now.",0
6003,You can't be a lawyer. You're eight.,2
6004,"Listen, it was nice to see you. I gotta run backstage.",1
6005,"Uh, wait, backstage?",2
6006,"Oh, yeah, my firm represents the band.",0
6007,Ross.,0
6008,Chandler.,0
6010,"Look, you guys wanna meet the group?",0
6011,Come on.,0
6012,"So, are you one of the ones who fooled around with my dad?",2
6013,Do you have any respect for your body?,5
6014,Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?,5
6015,"Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease.",3
6016,"The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.",0
6017,"Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.",0
6018,Really?,2
6019,He does?,2
6020,"Hey, buddy, what's up!",1
6021,"Oh, she told you about that, huh.",2
6022,"Well, yeah, I have one now and then.",0
6023,"Well, yeah, now.",0
6024,"Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before.",0
6025,"Well, okay, thanks!",1
6026,"God, he's good.",1
6027,If only he were a woman.,0
6028,Yeah.,0
6050,"Oh, look look look.",2
6051,The last candle's about to burn out.,0

6053,Thank you.,0
6054,Thanks.,0
6055,Kinda... spooky without any lights.,6

6057,"OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah...",1
6058,Oh.. oh... oh.,0
6059,"Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.",0
6060,"All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you about keeping Ben in your life?",0
6061,You blew them away!,1
6062,"Oh, I can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face!",1
6063,"I mean... uh, did you know you were  mouthing the words along with me?",0
6064,I was,2
6065,"No, it's ok! Made me feel like a rock star!",1
6066,Oh my God!  I'm your,2

6075,"Alright.  Yes, this is Rachel.",0
6076,Nooo!,2

6078,"Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much.",0
6079,"Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really.",1
6080,Green. To the green.,0
6081,I've got magic beans.  Never-never mind.,0
6082,"To the left, to the left- aww!",0
6083,Ohhh... I'm fine.,0
6084,Hey!,1
6085,Please tell me you got the message!,6
6086,What message?,0
6087,"The actor playing Mac couldn't do it, they needed to see you at 2 o'clock.",0
6088,What?! It's 6 o'clock!,2
6089,"Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board!",6
6090,"I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya!",3
6091,I went to Ross's!,0
6092,I went to the coffeehouse!,0
6093,I went to any place that they made sandwiches!,0
6094,"That's the day you're gonna die? See....darnit, I've got shuffleboard that day.",0
6095,That's what you think.,0
6096,"Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother's? Wouldn't they have the recipe?",0
6097,"Well, y'know I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.",0
6098,What was her name?,0
6099,Nestley Toulouse.,0
6100,Nestlé Toll House?,0
6101,"Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.",0
6103,Yes!!  Oh.,2
6104,I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!,3
6105,I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why  you're burning in hell!!,3
6106,"So, we're decided, no on plaid, yes on pink?",0
6107,Absolutely!,1
6108,I am so on board!,1
6109,Rachel didn't you just light that?,0
6110,"Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back, y'know?  Good luck, Rach.",0
6111,I've actually been thinking about quitting lately.,0
6112,"Oh sure, every Sunday night I'm telling myself I'm quitting but every Monday morning it's like",5
6113,Tell me about it!,0
6114,Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!,1
6115,It does sound appealing.,0
6116,"Oh, I never could do it.",1
6117,Oh but you could.,0
6118,You can.,0
6119,Absolutely!,1
6120,We can help each other out!,1
6121,We can get--what are those--those patches!,0
6122,We could be like the Patch Sisters!,1
6123,"Oh y'know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit!",1
6124,Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it!,1
6125,My late husband gave me that lighter.  I'm not kidding.,4
6126,Okay then!,1
6128,"Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?",0
6129,"Does, um, anyone wanna see?",0
6130,Nooo..,5
6131,"Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!",3
6132,It's worse than the thumb!,5
6133,"Hey, this is so unfair!",3
6134,"Oh, why is it unfair?",2
6135,So I have a flaw!,3
6136,Big deal!,3
6137,Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying?,3
6138,"And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word?",3
6139,"And Monica, with that snort when she laughs?",3
6140,"I mean, what the hell is that thing?",5
6141,"...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?",3
6142,...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?,3
6143,"Well, I-I could live without it.",0
6144,"Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?",0
6145,"Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.",0
6146,"Oh,  ""you do, do you""?",3
6147,"You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.",0
6148,"""Indeed there isn't""... I should really get back to work.",1
6149,"Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.",0
6150,"Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.",3
6151,Awww! Mel Torme died.,4
6152,"Joey, that paper's like a year old!",0
6153,Aw! Does that mean the,4
6154,Hey.,0
6155,Hey.,0
6156,You're sure? You're absolutely sure?,0
6157,"Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does.",0
6158,Probably?,0
6159,"Yeah, I don't like that word.",5
6160,Kind of what ‘probably' really means.,0
6161,"Yeah, uh-huh.",0
6162,"Yeah, oh, ""Your mom probably won't kill herself,"" y'know?",3
6163,"I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on ""Probably!""",3
6165,You gotta take care of yourselves!,0
6166,In,0
6167,"Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?",0
6168,Yoo-hoo! Aaron Litman-Neurolic would like to say hello to his future bride.,1
6169,Ohhh!  Wow! He kinda takes your breath away doesn't he?,1
6170,He's a keeper. How are you feeling?,0
6171,"Oh, I'm fine.",0
6172,"Can I just say, I really admire what you're doing. Just raising her all alone.",0
6173,"Oh, I'm not doing it alone. I have Ross.",0
6174,"Oh, sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?",0
6175,"Well then he gets a divorce, it's Ross!",0
6176,"I'm telling you Rachel, listen to Janice. They all say they're gonna be there until they start their real family.",0
6177,Well I....That's never gonna happen with Ross.,4
6178,"Oh well that's what I thought about my first husband, now I'm lucky if my kid gets to spend the weekend with her father and the twins and little Ms. New Boobs.",5
6180,"And Tim I just wanna say, good luck here.",0
6181,Hey. Who's that?,0
6182,New people.,0
6183,What happened to the Disgustingtons?,0
6184,They're having their baby!,3
6185,It's not fair Ross we got here first!,3
6186,Right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery.,0
6187,Oh but not before she gave me a juicy shot of little Jamie just crowning away.,0
6188,"Wow! Sorry. So uh, how are the new people?",2
6189,Phoebe?,0
6190,Yeah?,0
6191,"Look at that guy by the window, wow!",2
6192,"He's awfully short and I think he's talking to himself. And to be completely honest, he's not that good in bed.",0
6193,"Oh, what is wrong with me lately?",4
6194,I mean it's like every guy I see....I mean look here.,0
6195,"Look at that guy for example, I mean normally that's not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way I'm feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.",0
6196,"Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?",0
6197,Yeah.,0
6198,"This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy.",0
6199,Really?! So this has happened to you?,2
6200,Oh absolutely yeah!,0
6201,"Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so in, y'know, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy.",0
6202,"Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store sitting on Santa's lap.",1
6203,"Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield from a",0
6204,Ugh!,5
6205,I don't know what I'm going to do!,6
6206,I called the company that sent and th-they don't care!,3
6207,"Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn't an emergency, then what is?",3
6208,Hey guys!,1
6209,Hey!,1
6210,Hey,0
6211,"I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party!",1
6212,And the guys from work had a blast.,1
6213,"Y'know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before.",1
6214,Yeah!,1
6215,"And-and another one had never been to a party before, so",2
6216,"So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that's nice!",1
6217,"Yeah, right!",1
6218,"I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those",0
6219,"That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.",2
6220,"So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?",2
6221,"Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.",1
6222,"So you might say, it's a magic ring.",1
6223,OH MY GOD!! I didn't really believe it until you just said it!!,2
6224,Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.,0
6225,"Obviously! So, how do we decide?",0
6226,"Well now let's-let's look at this objectively, I think I should date her",0
6227,Uh-huh. Uh-huh.,0
6228,"That's interesting, but check this out. I date her",1
6229,Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction,0
6230,"Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.",0
6231,Yeah well we should order some food then.,0
6232,"No Joey! Look why don't, why don't we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, we'll",0
6233,That sounds fair.,0
6234,Maybe I'll take her to that new French restaurant down the street,0
6235,Ah yeah....wait a second now!,3
6236,Look we're gonna have to set a spending limit on the date.,0
6237,I don't have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.,3
6238,"Well sorry, that's what I do on dates.",0
6239,"All right, well I guess I'll just have to do what I do on dates.",0
6240,So let's decide on the spending limit,0
6241,"Yeah. Uh, …a slice……six dollars?",0
6242,I was thinking more like a hundred.,0
6243,Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?,0
6244,"Hi, again.",0
6245,Hey!,0
6246,Hey!,0
6247,"Thank you soo, much.",1
6248,"Oh, don't thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work.",3
6249,You want some help with that?,0
6250,"Oh, no thanks, I got it.  No I don't!",0
6251,Whoa! Are you okay?,2
6252,"Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.",2
6253,It's the heat.  And-and the humidity.,0
6254,"That's a uh, that's a tough combination.",0
6255,Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?,0
6256,Like you wouldn't believe.  Wow! This is a great place.,2
6257,What do you mean?,0
6258,Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh.,0
6259,Oh!,2
6260,"Hey, somebody left their keys.",0
6261,"Ooohh, to a Porsche!",2
6265,"Hey Gunther, these yours?",0
6266,"Yeah, that's what I drive. I make four bucks an hour, I saved up for 350 years!",5
6267,Na-uh!  Hey did anybody lose their keys?,0
6268,"Joey, why don't you put them in the lost and found?",0
6269,There's a lost and found?  My shoe!,2
6270,You left a shoe here?!,2
6271,"Well, I didn't realize until I got home.",0
6272,I wasn't gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe!,0
6274,I'm gonna go find that guy's car and leave a note on the windshield.,0
6275,"Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I'll be sure to give him your shoe.",0
6276,Great! Thanks.,1
6277,"Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.",0
6278,"Carol, we've been through this before, ok?",1
6279,We have a good time.,1
6280,"We laugh, we play.",1
6281,It's like we're father and son.,1
6282,"Honey, relax. Ross is great with him.  Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person.",1
6283,"Oh, this is so cute.",1
6284,"Oh, I got that for him.",0
6285,My mommies love me. That's clever.,1
6286,Hello?,0
6287,"Oh, Hi, Ju........Hi, Jew!",0
6288,Uh huh?,0
6289,Uh huh?,0
6290,"Ok.  Um, sure, that'd be great.",0
6291,See ya then.,0
6292,Bye.,0
6293,"Did you just say Hi, Jew?",2
6294,"Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.",0
6295,Now there you go! I wouldn't want my best guest to strain her eyes!,1
6296,Thanks Monica!,1
6297,Does that smell bother you?,5
6298,"What the smell from Joey's? No, I can hardly smell it over here.",2
6299,"Well you let me know if you can, because y'know I can bake a pie to cover it.",0
6300,"I can smell it a little, bake the pie.",1
6301,Okay!,1
6302,Okay.,0
6303,"Hello?  Oh yes, one minute please.  It's for you. It's the fire inspector.",0
6304,Oh!  Hello?  Yeah this is Phoebe.  Really?!,2
6305,"Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn't the hair straightener that started the fire.",0
6306,"No-no, it was the candles.",0
6307,It's very not good leaving candles unattended.,0
6308,"In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is…  Uhh… Uhh… Okay.",0
6309,"Well, I have to go now.",0
6310,Joey proposed to me.,2
6311,Is he crazy?! You just had Ross's baby!,2
6312,"Well, I-I said yes.",6
6313,What?!,2
6314,Are you crazy?,3
6315,You just had Ross's baby!,3
6316,It's-it's so  inappropriate.,3
6317,"No, it's worse than that.",5
6318,It's wrong.,5
6319,It's… It is bigger than  mine!,2
6320,I know.,0
6321,You can't marry him!,4
6322,Why not? I don't want to do this alone! And he's such a sweet  guy and he loves me so much.,4
6323,Well do you love him?,0
6324,Sure.,0
6325,Sure?,0
6326,"Yeah, I mean whatever.",0
6327,"Honey, the question is…do you really want to marry Joey?",4
6328,"No. No, I don't. Could you be a dear and go tell him?",4
6329,So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?,0
6330,Here comes the bride.,1
6331,Oh my God Monica!,2
6332,I wanna wear this everyday.,1
6333,You look so beautiful.,1
6334,I'm so happy for me.,1
6335,Hello?,0
6336,Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?,6
6337,"Yeah, we got him back. Everything's fine.",0
6338,Damnit!,3
6343,"I will be! Listen, I don't want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?",3
6344,Fine.,0
6345,"Fine, but I'll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel.",3
6346,And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I'll go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that's what you want!,3
6347,"No that's not what I want. Uh, I'm glad you guys were bonding but I",0
6348,"Look he doesn't have any brothers or sisters, somebody's gonna have to teach him this stuff!",4
6349,And I haven't taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesn't know anyway!,0
6350,Crap!!,3
6351,I gotta go!,0
6352,Look at that! Look at that! They're going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there?,2
6353,No.,0
6354,Me neither! We have to get in!,2
6355,Just act like you belong.,0
6356,Oh my God! Oranges!,2
6357,Shh!  Nice to see you again.,0
6358,"Uh sir, may I see your tickets please?",0
6359,"Yes, of course.",0
6360,"I'm sorry, would you move your thumb? I can't see the seat number.",0
6361,"Oh that's all right, I have it memorized. It's 1A.",0
6366,Okay!,1
6367,Y'know what?,0
6368,I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids.,1
6369,All I really needed was a plan.,0
6370,See I wanna have three kids,0
6371,"Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.",1
6372,As I was saying… I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I'm 35 which gives me five years.,0
6375,You spent a hundred dollars. That's the limit. You're screwed!,1
6376,"Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So technically,",3
6377,Oh-oh! So that's the way it's gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too y'know!,3
6378,Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?,3
6379,I don't know.,0
6380,Why am I not surprised?,5
6381,Y'know what Ross? I'm not gonna let you get away with this!,3
6382,I don't think you have much choice.,0
6383,Well we'll see!,3

6390,"Hi. God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work.",1
6391,"Dad, we-we can't believe you're selling the house.",4
6392,"Well, it's time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.",0
6393,Let's grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.,0
6394,I'm sorry we can't store your childhood things anymore.,4
6395,"Oh, that's okay, I can't wait to see everything again! All of the memories",1
6396,"Well, I don't know what's in the boxes down here, but I do know there are six or seven",0
6397,I used to,0
6398,"Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.",0
6399,"Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a",0
6400,"Ok, got the vent open.",0
6401,"Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!",1
6402,"Ben, you ready?",0
6403,"All right, gimme your foot.",0
6404,"Ok, on three, Ben.",0
6405,"One, two, three.",0
6406,"Ok, That's it, Ben.",0
6407,What do you see?,0
6408,"Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent.",0
6409,"Phoebs, It's open! It's open!",2
6410,Wait! You forgot your legs!,2
6411,"You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system.",1
6412,Thank you.,1
6413,Filing system?,0
6414,Oh-oh!,2
6415,You mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders?,0
6416,It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.,1
6417,"Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.",0
6418,I notice that you've been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities.,0
6419,"Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.",1
6420,Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. It's amazing how she gets it right almost,1
6421,"I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.",0
6422,"Oh yes, well there's the coffee too.  Rachel can carry two things at once!",1
6423,"Yes, that's very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.",0
6424,"Yes, I realize that",0
6425,"And Rachel shouldn't have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.",0
6426,I love working with designers!,1
6427,"With them, under them, what's the difference? Eh, Rach?",0
6428,"Chandler, you have an assistant right?",0
6429,Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!,6
6430,"Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.",0
6431,I do?,2
6432,"Yeah!  All right, maybe you don't have to smile. Let's try something else. Let's try umm, try looking sexy.",0
6433,Okay.,0
6434,Or not.,0
6435,Where's Chandler?,0
6436,Here I am.,0
6437,Wash your hands!!!,5
6438,How did you…know?,2
6439,Hey! What's she doing back here?,2
6440,"Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!",0
6441,"Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...",0
6442,What happened in Atlantic City?!,2
6443,"Well, Chandler and I are in a bar",0
6444,"Did you not hear me say, ""Du-ude?!""",3
6445,"And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay?",0
6446,"So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing.",0
6447,"Now, I know what you're thinking, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you're right, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with…girls.",1
6448,You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.,2
6449,"In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.",3
6450,"Oh Mon, I laughed so hard",1
6451,"Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?",3
6452,"Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.",0
6453,"So umm, you're gonna stay with me as long as I need you?",0
6454,Of course I am!,1
6455,"Oh mom, I swear I'm not an idiot.",0
6456,"I've read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth, but I-I just didn't think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes.",0
6457,And-and then guess what?,0
6458,The baby's coming and I don't know what to do.,4
6459,"Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie?",4
6460,"No. Sweetie, you're gonna be fine.",0
6461,Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?,6
6462,I'm going to the bathroom.,0
6463,Okay.,0
6464,Now don't worry! Everything's gonna be okay.,0
6465,It,0
6466,Hey!,1
6467,Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?,2
6468,I just Bamboozled Chandler!  Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower.,0
6469,Not if you were here.,0
6470,"Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.",0
6471,Oh my God! This is it!   I really hope it's you!,1
6472,I hope it's you.,0
6473,Me too!,1
6474,"First of all um, I love you both so much and you're both so important to me",1
6475,"Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!",1
6476,"Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade off being maid of honor for each other.",0
6477,"Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine",0
6478,Yes!!! Oh!!,1
6479,Hypothetically!,3
6480,Still.,0
6481,If Phoebe were my maid of honor,0
6483,"Rachel would be Phoebe's, I would be Rachel's, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.",0
6484,Yeah that's actually a pretty good idea.,0
6485,"Yeah, I'll do that. So who gets to be yours?",0
6486,"Well that's the best part. Umm,",0
6487,Wh-why is that the best part?,2
6488,Because then I don't have to!,1
6489,Well of,0
6490,I'm really not deciding!,1
6491,Fine!,3
6493,"Aww, and good luck to you too!  What a nice lady!",1
6494,"If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a phial of small pox to release in the hallway?",0
6495,It's not just the drum noise.,0
6496,"Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, ""Oh my eye!",3
6497,"Oh god, my eye!""",3
6498,"I mean, it is so annoying.",3
6499,"Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.",0
6500,"Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?",2
6501,Maybe on some level.,0
6502,Joey? Could you get that?  What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?,2
6503,"No, I'm picking you up for our date. These are for you.",0
6504,"Ohh, Lilies. Joey, they're my favorite. Thank you.",1
6505,"And, a brownie!",1
6506,"Well, half a brownie.",0
6507,"Actually, it's just bag.",0
6508,It's been a long walk from the flower shop and I was startin' to feel faint so,0
6509,Oh man!,1
6510,This is so great!,1
6511,I actually feel like I'm going on a real date!,1
6512,"Although, I have a hint of morning sickness, and I'm wearing underwear that goes up to about……there.",0
6513,"Hey come on now, this is a real date.",0
6514,"Uh, so…nice place you got here.",0
6515,"Foosball, huh?",2
6516,Pizza box.,0
6517,"Oh, a subscription to",2
6518,"Yeah, actually that's my roommate's.",0
6519,I would like to meet him. He sounds like a stand up guy.,0
6520,"Ah yes, but he's very protective of me so you'd better watch yourself.",0
6521,"Ah… Hey, so this roommate of yours…is he good looking?",1
6522,Hm-mmm,0
6523,"Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?",0
6524,"Yeah, but I'm pretty sure he's gay.",0
6525,"No-no-no-no, he's not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come on!",3
6526,Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?,3
6527,"Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive.",0
6528,"Ha. Ha, ha.",1
6529,What?,0

6534,Oooooh.  : Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview!,1
6535,"Well, not playing raquetball!",2
6536,He forgot to leave his grip size!,2
6537,He didn't get the goggles!,2
6538,"Well,sounds like you two have issues.",0
6539,"Goodbye, baby.",0
6540,"Ciao, bela.",0
6541,Do they wait for me to do this?,0
6542,So are you gonna tell him?,0
6543,Why would I tell him?,0
6544,"How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might.",0
6546,What are you guys doing here?,3
6547,Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!,2
6548,...What did I ask?,0
6549,God. I feel violated.,5
6550,"Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?",5
6551,"Ross, ten o'clock.",0
6552,Is it? Feels like two.,4
6553,"No,",0
6555,"There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!",1
6556,Oh. Hel-lo!,1
6557,"She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!",1
6558,"Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.",1
6559,"Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'",6
6560,"Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!",1
6561,"Oh please, could she",0
6562,He could never get a woman like that in a million years.,0
6564,"Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.",0
6565,You could do that!,1
6566,You think?,2
6567,"OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down.",0
6568,OK.,0
6569,"This is great!  Helen, could you come in here for a moment?",1
6570,"Thank you Helen, that'll be all.",0
6571,"Last time I do that, I promise.",0
6572,"I am so, so, so, so sorry!",4

6583,I can't date you or have a hot plate in my office.,0
6584,I can't believe we have to stop seeing each other.,4
6585,For what it's worth I did appreciate you standing up for me. It felt really nice. It kinda made me like you even more.,1
6586,"I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we can't date. It's against the rules. It's forbidden.",0
6587,Wow!,2
6588,What?,2
6589,"Just hearing you describe it as forbidden, it's really hot.",1
6590,Really?,2
6591,Yeah.,0
6592,"Well I-I-I don't care how hot it is it's-it's uh, it's wrong.",1

6615,Oh y'know what?,0
6617,Now that you know what you want you should go to Kleinman's and get it half off.,0
6618,This place is so overpriced.,5
6619,"So, does this  come in another color or",0
6620,"I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time.",0
6621,It was unbelievable!,2
6622,"We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...",1
6623,So have you called her yet?,0
6624,Let her know I like her?,6
6625,"What are you, insane?",3

6627,How needy do I want to seem?,0
6628,"I'm right, right?",0
6629,"Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.",0
6630,I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.,2
6631,"Oh, God, just do it!  Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!",3
6632,"Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat.  I got her machine.",0
6633,Her answer machine?,0
6634,"No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.",0
6635,"So, uh, why didn't you say anything?",0
6636,"Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase ""Yes indeedy-o.""",5

6638,"Okay, okay, what's going on?",0
6639,"Okay, they're just talking...",0
6640,"Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?",0
6641,"So, um, what do you do for a living?",0

6645,Now that is funny.,0
6646,"Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us?",0
6647,"Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.",4
6648,I guess.,0
6649,Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?,0

6663,When I was six years old.,0
6664,Hm-mm,0

6667,"It was embarrassing, kids made fun of me.",4
6668,That was a pretty tough year.,4
6669,That's-that's great!,1

6677,Oh!,2
6678,"Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one?",3
6679,That's patio furniture!,2
6680,"So what, like people are gonna come in and think, ""Uh-oh, I'm outside again?"" Of course!",0
6681,What about the birds?,0
6682,"I don't know, birds just don't say, ""Hello, sit here, eat something.""",0
6683,You pick one.,0
6684,"All right, how about the ladybugs?",0
6685,"Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!",3
6686,"Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!",3
6687,"Not like that, I won't!  Kip would have liked the birds!",4
6688,Bijan for men?,0

6691,"Oh, actually I sorta have plans.",0
6692,"Ready, Annabelle?",0
6693,You bet.  Maybe some other time?,0
6694,"Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne.  Bijan for men?  Bijan for men?!",4
6695,That was amazing!,1
6696,Phoebe and Gary are,0

6708,"Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.",4
6709,"Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don't I have to wait a while?",4
6710,"Hey, this isn't like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!",3
6711,Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.,0
6712,"Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.",0
6713,Why? What happened to him?,0
6714,"Nothing, he's just really believes in that.",0
6715,It looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.,0

6717,"Well, okay, so what's now....go get, go get the eggs, put ‘em in there.",0

6720,"Um-hmm, five actually.",0
6721,"Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?",0
6722,We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.,0
6723,That's it! 25 percent? That means that's it's like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!,2
6724,"Hey, y'know I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there?",0
6725,"Sweety, now, she's a woman, not a gumball machine.",0
6726,"Okay, well y'know what, don't worry you guys, ‘cause I'm-I'm gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.",0
6727,"Well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot to make it right.",0
6728,"Umm, it costs $16,000 each time you do this.",0
6729,"So, umm, we're kinda using all the money we have to do it just this one time.",0
6730,"Whoa!! That....okay, that's a",5
6731,"No, I'm sorry.",0
6732,Wow! You guys really don't know anything!,2

6766,"Okay, now we just need something borrowed!",1
6767,Here just…take this.,0

7831,"I'm not gonna be able to do that for so long, and it's so much fun!",1

7852,"Okay. . Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you    here.",2
7853,I can't believe you married him.,2

7855,So what about us? Everything we feel for each other.,4
7856,It's over! You,1
7857,How can I?,2
7858,"Knowing I'll never hold you in my arms again,    or touch your skin, or feel your lips, knowing I'll never make love to you?",4
7859,How can I accept that...,4
7860,I can never kiss you again when it's all I can do not    to kiss you right now.,4
7861,Kiss me.,1
7862,What?,2

7864,The bigger half.,0
7865,I'd like to propose a toast.,1
7866,"Little toast here, ding ding.",1
7867,"I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting.",1
7868,"Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know?",3
7869,So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.,1
7870,That's so sweet.,1
7871,"And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.",1
7872,And a crappy New Year.,1

7878,She's-she's just a friend and that's all!,3
7879,That's all!,4
7880,Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else.,3
7881,"Please, promise me that you'll tell her that.",4
7882,"All right, I'll tell her.  Come on bugger face!",3
7883,Call me.,0
7884,"You spend half your life in the bathroom, why don't you ever go out the bloody window!",3

7898,You fell asleep?,2
7899,"But only because I was up all night worried about this  meeting, ain't that funny?",6
7900,Irony?,2
7901,"Not a fan, alright .",0
7902,"See, here's  the thing.",0
7903,I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won't go.,0

7905,Tulsa is heaven!,1
7906,Tulsa is Italy....Please don't make me go  there!,6
7907,"Chandler, I…",1
7908,No no no!,6
7909,"Look, Carol, can I call you Carol?",0
7910,Wh-why  would I when your name is Elaine?,1
7911,"Oh what a great picture of your son,  strapping!",1
7912,"That's a picture of your daughter, isn't it,  well she's lovely.",1
7913,I like a girl with a strong jaw.,4

7922,Oh. Thanks.,0
7923,"No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing",1
7924,"Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'.",0
7925,I just can't believe you're in here.,2
7926,"I mean, what am I gonna do without you?",4
7927,Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me?,4
7928,Who's gonna take me to the,4
7929,"Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.",5

8332,"Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?",2
8333,Are you serious?!,2

8335,Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!,2
8336,"Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal!  Yeah, my pants are a little loose!",3

8368,"One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.",0
8369,"Ok, thanks Pheebs  Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!",2
8370,"Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies",0
8371,"All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.",2
8372,Which proves that I never lie.,0
8373,I guess you don't.,0
8374,Paolo made a pass at me.,4
8375,"I'm so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.",6
8376,I'm not freaking out.,0
8377,Why would I be freaking out?,0
8378,"A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.",0
8379,"Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun!",3
8380,"I mean, what's the harm in that?",0
8381,Right here!,4
8382,"Chandler, please don't think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel",3
8383,Phoebe and Rachel!,3
8384,"So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!",4
8385,"It was a mistake. Please don't take this to mean anything, because it doesn't.",4
8386,Okay.,0
8387,Really?,1
8388,"Yes, if it really doesn't mean anything, because you know that I'm just not ready",0
8389,I know! I know.,0
8390,Okay.,0
8391,I'm gonna go tell Joey that  that you're back. I was really worried about you.,3
8392,"Hey, did she buy it?",0
8393,Totally.,0
8394,So did Heldi show you the place?,0
8395,"Yeah, it's beautiful.",0
8396,I can't believe you're gonna ask Monica to marry you!,1
8397,I know.,0
8400,"Okay look, I have an idea.",0
8401,"Why don't we, why don't we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him.",0
8402,And then whoever does gets the phone.,0
8406,"All right, first name on the speed dial is mom.",0
8407,"Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.",4
8408,"Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.",4
8409,Did I use that already today? I'm sorry.,4
8412,Joe.,0
8419,"Oh, I win! He's got",1
8420,So you don't know that's,0
8421,His new girlfriend!,2
8422,I can't believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?,2
8423,"I don't know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding.",4
8424,She's saving the rest for her divorce.,3
8425,And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to,0
8426,Well what happened at dinner?,0
8427,My parents spent the money for our wedding!,3
8428,My God! What did you order?!,2
8429,"Wait, but there's no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!",4
8430,"Honey, it's gonna be okay.",0
8431,No! No it's not! It's not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!,4
8432,"No, y'know what?",0
8433,It's gonna be okay.,0
8434,I mean you don't have to have this rustic Italian feast.,0
8435,Y'know?,0
8436,"And-and you don't need, you don't need this custom-made, empire-waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack.",0
8437,"Dr. Geller, there's a seat over here.",0
8438,"Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but I'm having my lunch at this table, here in the middle.",0
8439,"I'm having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if he'll sit with me.",0
8440,I will sit with you Dr. Geller.,0
8441,"Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch.",0
8442,"Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y'know what I see, I see-I see division.",4
8443,"Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, ""My God why?!""",6
8444,"Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath.",0
8445,I'm Ross!,1
8446,"I'm divorced, and I have a kid!",1
8447,I'm Joey! I'm an actor! I don't know squat about dinosaurs!,1

8449,"All right, there you go!",1
8450,"Yeah, you hang in there Teddy!",3
8451,"I'm Andrew, and I didn't pay for this pear.",0
8452,"Okay, good-good for you.",1
8453,"I'm Rhonda,  and these aren't real!",0
8454,"Wow, Rhonda.",2
8455,I'm Scott.,0
8456,"Yeah, okay, Scott!",0
8457,And I need to flip the light switch on and off 17 times before I leave a room or my family will die.,6
8458,So thanks for the warm welcome.,0
8459,"It's good to have you guys on my team, and I come to play.",1
8460,I hope you do too.,0
8461,"Now, let's go out there and get ‘em!",1
8463,"And remember, there is no ‘I' in team.",0

8471,Yeah. You won't be able to take it.,0
8472,"So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?",0
8473,They're gonna call her Chandler.,0
8474,"That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?",0
8475,Works on you.,0
8476,"Oh, that is so sweet.",1
8477,"No, no, ok, you hang up.",1

8501,"Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one.",1
8502,Ben is way cuter than that kid.,1
8503,"I mean look at him, look at you,",5
8504,"That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?",0
8505,"Joey, you look nothing like Ben.",0
8506,I look more like him than you do!,3
8507,"Y'know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that.",1
8508,That really was some of your best work.,1
8509,"Hm-hmm, I told you!  I can't believe that I've only got two hours before I call in sick for work.",0
8510,I have to be up in seven minutes.,0
8511,"Well, you're not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes",0
8512,Really?!,2
8513,Do you wanna?,0
8514,Okay! You get the vacuum cleaner and I'll get the furniture polish!,1
8515,Oh okay. But y'know what? Be careful. Because a guy who was helping me before had to leave because he hurt his back.,0

8536,"Okay. Yeah.  Yeah, I'll grab this one.",0
8537,Hey.,0
8538,"Listen, um...",0
8539,I'm sorry.,4
8540,": Yeah, um...  You know you, you should just forget about what I said under the bridge, I was talkin'",0
8541,"That's right, I don't... But I was, I was drunk on you!",4
8542,"Okay, yeah, so it's not gonna work.",0
8543,"If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?",0
8544,"Um, then yes, it's 'cause of Phoebe! So, you know, it's either her or me.",3
8545,"You know...  You're gonna be really, really hard to get over.",4
8546,"By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me.",0
8547,"Oh, hello liar.",3
8548,"Look, I-I'm really sorry I let go of the bike.",4
8549,I could've been killed I hope you know!,3
8550,"I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were",4
8551,"Well, I would love to but…the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects.",1
8552,Phoebe.,0
8553,What?!  What the hell?!,3
8554,"All right, y'know what?",3
8555,"If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then I'm sorry, I'm just gonna have to take it back.",3
8556,What?! Why?!,2
8557,"Because! Because, it-it-it's… It'd be like you having this guitar  and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar",3
8558,"All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.",3
8559,Great! Great!  You're making the bike very happy.,1
8560,Okay Ross!  Please don't die!,3
8561,How could you have kept all of this from me?,6
8562,"I was going to tell you, but",0
8563,But what?! You figured you'd get what you wanted and then dump her like you dumped Rachel!,3
8564,Hey! I did not dump Rachel!  Nor are we still together.  Can I just…  Why don't we just let the machine get that?,3
8565,Hey Ross. It's Joey. There's a hooker over here and we thought maybe you'd know something about it.,0
8566,"No! No! No! No! No! I-I-I-I....I need to, I need to lie down.",0
8567,Everything on your application looks really good....Ohh!,1
8568,"Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?",3
8569,"Oh don't worry, I'm not really a party girl.",0
8570,"Whoa!! Now look, don't be just blurtin' stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?",1
8571,You can call off the roommate search!  Hi! I'll be living here.,1
8572,"Oh don't listen to him, he's just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don't think he's gonna get it.",4
8573,Why did you take the shower curtain down?,2
8574,That thing was a hazard!  I'm very safety conscious.,6
8575,Hi.,0
8576,"Hey man, how did the audition go?",0
8577,Estelle said I didn't get it.,4
8578,What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!,2
8579,"Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me.",1
8580,No!,2
8581,"For all I know, she's trying to find me but couldn't because I kept moving around.",0
8582,"No, from now on, I'm staying in one place.",0
8583,Right here.,0
8584,"Well, it's getting late.",0
8585,"Yeah, we're gonna go.",0
8586,"Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?",0
8587,"Ugh, y'know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.",0
8588,"Yeah, it's a very large plane.",0
8589,That's cool.,0
8590,"But, we'll stay here with you.",0
8591,"Thanks guys!  I really appreciate this, y'know, but you don't have to rub my butt.",1
8592,"Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.",2
8593,They're not a couple!,2
8594,"Oh-okay, I get the game now.",0
8595,"Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?",0
8596,Oh yeah!,1
8597,"Well okay, so then you're fine.",0
8598,The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone.,0
8599,Okay?,0
8600,So as long as it's hot onstage you got nothing to worry about.,0
8601,"It's when the heat goes away, that's when you're in trouble.",0
8602,Really?,2
8603,"Look, you guys have been to every play I've ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?",0
8604,No.,0
8605,Noooo!!,0
8606,"Ursula!  Wait! Err-err, it's me! Phoebe!",2
8607,"Oh, I thought there was a mirror there. Okay, bye-bye.",0
8608,"Wait a second! So, what's new with you?",2
8609,"Umm, nothing. I mean, I'm getting married next week.",0
8610,And your breasts! Hmm!!!,2
8611,Okay.,0
8612,"Umm look, you're coming on a little strong.",6
8613,"But I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to be together.",0
8614,"So, why don't we just start over okay?",0
8615,And you can just tell me about yourself.,0
8616,All right.,0
8617,Okay.,0
8618,"I write erotic novels, for children.",0
8619,What?!,2
8620,They're wildly unpopular.,0
8621,Oh my God!,5
8622,"Oh also, you might be interested to know that I have a Ph.D.",0
8623,Wow! You do?,2
8624,"Yeah,  a Pretty Huge",1
8625,All right.,5
8626,"So, uh, how's she doing?",4
8627,The doctor says it's a matter of hours.,4
8628,"How-how are you, Mom?",4
8629,"Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair?",3
8630,What?,2
8631,What's different?,2
8632,Nothing.,0
8633,"Oh, maybe that's it.",0
8634,"She is unbelievable, our mother is...",3
8635,"Okay, relax, relax.",0
8636,"We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.",0
8637,Oh God!,2
8638,The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.,0
8639,Oh!,2
8640,"...Yeah, they were gross.",5
8641,"Oh, you know what I loved?",1
8642,Her Sweet 'n' Los.,1
8643,How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.,1
8644,"Not just restaurants, from our house.",0
8645,Maybe.,0
8646,You can't!,2
8647,Why?  Seriously I did not understand a word that    you said.,2
8648,In the hall.,0
8649,"Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping.",0
8650,But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose.,0
8651,"Like, chasing their tail,  or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.",0
8652,"Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.",0
8653,That's a good one!,1
8654,"Hey, Joe.",0
8655,"Dad, Ronni's here.",0
8656,Huh?,2
8657,"So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if there's anything that you like, we can make you a deal.",0
8658,Anything at all.,0
8659,But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.,0
8660,"Well, thanks a lot for hookin' me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.",1
8661,I'm Monica's maid of honor. Okay? Don't try to blue pin me!,3
8662,"Oh here, I think this is us.  Yeah.",0
8663,Limited seating my ass. Let's see who made the cut.  Hi!,3
8664,I'm Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom?,0
8665,Used to work with her. Used to! I'm a relative and I didn't get invited! A,3
8666,"Stop saying, ""Blood"" to strangers.",4
8667,"So, how about you huh? How do you know the happy couple?",1
8668,"Okay, you're fine.",0
8669,"Monica, why have you brought me here of all places?!",2
8670,You'll see.,0
8671,"I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen.",1
8673,"Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and y'know fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles",0
8674,"And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? And the chairs can face this way , and…  You go.",0
8675,"But-but, if you don't love this, we'll do it in any other place at any other time.",0
8676,"Really, it's fine, whatever you want.",0
8677,It's perfect.,1
8678,"And, I don't know, if it starts to rain",1
8679,Well then we'll get wet.,3
8680,Ohh. And I don't even have a date.,4
8681,Coming.,0
8682,I have a bone to pick with you.,3
8683,Uh-oh.,6
8684,Yes! Ben learned a little trick.,3
8685,Oh yeah? Did he pull the old,2
8686,That's right! That's right!,1
8687,Oh that.,0
8688,Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They're mean and they're stupid and-and I don't want my son learning them!,3
8689,Y'know what? It doesn't matter! Because it is not true!,3
8690,Okay.,0
8691,"And if it were true, how",0
8692,Ms. Monroe…  Oh there you go.,0
8693,Mark's a genius!,2
8694,Why?! How?! How is he a genius?,2
8695,"Look, don't you see what's happening here.",3
8696,"Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant.",3
8697,Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.,0
8698,What am I going to do?,6
8699,"Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that.",0
8700,"All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.",0
8701,I don't know you guys.,6
8702,"All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you.",5
8703,"And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'",5
8704,"And before you know it, she's with him.",3
8705,"And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!'",3
8706,"And he'll be all, 'Yes!'",3
8707,"And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.'",1
8708,"And pretty soon you'll be like,  'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.'",5
8709,"And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'",5
8710,He paints quite a picture doesn't he?,0

8813,Wait! You're going out with Kathy!,2
8814,Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?,2
8815,"Well, I'm upset....for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.",5
8816,What is the big deal? It's not like we're exclusive.,4
8817,"Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs.",3
8818,"But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she's-she's smart, and funny, and gets you.",0

9094,Joey!,3
9095,What?! All right....Hey! Don't look at me! You're the one who wanted to come up and look for some stupid,3

9112,Alan.,0

9115,"I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.",1
9116,"Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..",1
9117,Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..,0
9118,What?,2
9119,"..I dunno, a little too Alan?",0
9120,"Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.",1
9121,"Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.",1
9122,I personally could have a gallon of Alan.,1
9123,"Well I had a great time! Learned how to bake, ate great food, that's the first A I've gotten since seventh grade,",1
9124,"Oh, look! Acting for Beginners! Want to feel good about yourself?",6
9125,What the hell!,2
9126,Okay.,0
9127,"All right, let's start with some basics. Can anybody tell me what the difference between upstage and downstage is?",0
9128,"Yeah, this was a stupid idea.",5
9129,My God!,2
9130,These pants are burning up!,2
9131,"Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now!",2
9132,What is she trying to kill me?,3
9133,It's like a volcano in here!,2
9134,Are you hot?,0
9135,"Okay, it must just be me then.",0
9136,"That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I use your bathroom?",0
9137,You're driving me crazy with that!,3
9138,"Okay, I'll stop.",0
9139,Don't stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!,3
9140,"Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.",3
9141,You wanna play?,0
9142,"Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon.",0
9143,And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.,0
9144,"Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.",0
9145,"All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?",1
9146,I'm intrigued.,0
9147,"All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.",0
9148,"Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.",1
9149,"Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.",1
9150,Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?,0
9151,"Uh yeah, right here.",0
9152,"Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends?  Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?",1
9153,What's that?,0
9154,"Weeeell, it's rum, and-",0
9155,I'm sure they'll be here soon.,0
9156,"Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this.",0
9157,Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.,0
9158,You are really frightening me.,6
9159,"Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart.  Uh, that's great.  Anybody seen a nipple?",6
9160,"All right, ten centimeters, here we go.",0
9161,"All right, honey, time to start pushing.",0
9162,But they're not here yet!,6
9163,"I'm sorry, I can't tell the baby to wait for them.",0
9164,"Oh, god.",6
9165,"Here we go. Mona umm, I think it's time we-we had a conversation about-about where things are with us.",1
9166,"Yeah, I-I think I suggested that.",0
9167,"Aw, we-we are so… So umm, well I-I-I like you and I-I love umm, y'know hanging out with you.",1
9168,And I mean-I'm having a lot of fun.,1
9169,Okay.,0
9170,"I mean, there's no point in spending time with someone if-if it's just fun.",0
9171,"It's gotta be, it's gotta be going somewhere right?",1
9172,So where-where is it going?,0
9173,Ah!,2
9174,That's-that's the real question.,0
9175,And-and the answer is…is it's going somewhere…fun.,1
9176,"Now I-I know what you're thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago y'know, but you're-you're not getting any younger.",0
9177,"No I mean....No not you, not you, you....you",6
9178,"I'm sorry, so umm, so where are we?",4
9179,Y'know what?,0
9180,I am going to take you out to dinner tonight.,1

9182,No?,3
9183,Really?,2
9184,They taste so good.,1
9185,Drum roll.,0
9186,"Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?",0
9187,"Nah, you're not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney.",0
9188,"All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.",0
9189,You're actually going through with this?,2
9190,"Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life.",3
9191,"Okay, it's probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women… So, as of 4 o'clock tomorrow, I'm either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.",0
9192,You got problems because of you!,3
9193,Not your name!,4
9194,"All right, this has got to stop!",3
9195,Chandler is a great name!,3
9196,"In fact....yes,  I'm, I'm sorry.",4
9197,"I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, I'm-I'm, I'm gonna, I'm gonna name the baby Chandler.",0
9198,Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!,2
9199,It was.,0
9200,"Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, that's not gonna be me, not me.",4
9201,Wow! That was good. That was... Tweezers?,2
9202,No.,0
9203,Whoa. That was really good.,2
9204,"Thanks, any suggestions?",0
9206,You-you…you had sex with Ursula?!,2
9207,"Uh, a little bit. She-she-she walked in and I thought she was you and I kissed her and",6
9208,You didn't notice she was wearing different clothes?!,2
9209,Well I was just so excited to see you.,4
9210,Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Y'know what? This is too weird.,5
9211,No-no it's not!,4
9212,I don't want to lose you!,6
9213,It's-it's like I was saying to Ursula when I was making love to her and I thought she was you....Yeah it is too weird.,4
9214,So I guess this is it.,4
9215,Yeah.  Maybe it's for the best. You smell just like her.,4
9216,"Yeah, so do you.",3
9217,Hey!,1
9218,Hi.,0
9219,"So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?",0

9222,You can?,2
9223,Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.,0
9224,Um-hmm.,0
9225,And a small piece of chocolate.,0
9226,Okay.,0
9227,"Okay, we have to talk. I'm just getting out of a very serious relationship",4
9228,"I know! And I'm just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be!",6
9229,Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.,1
9230,"Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time.",4
9231,"I hear ya.  But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!",5
9232,Oh no! Where to?  Too Paris?,2
9233,"No! No! Not, Paris.",0
9234,"Too London? No-no, Rome? Vienna? Ooh-ooh, Barcelona?",1
9235,"Okay, could you just stop talking for a second?  Yemen. That's right, yes, I'm being transferred to Yemen!",3
9236,When?,3
9237,I don't know exactly.,0
9238,"Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.",4
9239,But I do know that it's some time tomorrow.,1
9240,"Ooh, this is it!  Oh, that's him! That's him!",1
9241,Great! Go get him.,1
9242,"Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first.",0
9243,He's not really my type.,0
9244,"No not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see what's he like. People tell doctors everything.",0
9246,"But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks.",4
9247,You do attract some stinkers.,4
9248,Chandler.,0
9249,"Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a",0
9250,"Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.",0
9251,"Oh, listen.",0
9252,"If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them.",0
9253,Really.,1
9254,Nothing at all.,0
9255,Really.,1
9256,Nothing.,0
9257,"Y'know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?",0
9258,Of course! Joey wouldn't let you have one?,4
9259,"No. When it comes to sweets, he's surprisingly strict.",4
9260,"Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you're moving out?",0
9261,"No, no, I keep trying, y'know?",3
9262,"I can get out, ""Joey, I have too…"" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, ""…go to the bathroom.""",4
9263,He may think I'm sick.,0
9264,"Y'know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I… We just have to get it over with!",0
9265,"Y'know, the next time we see them we're just gonna tell them.",0
9267,That's it.,0
9268,"Oh, so that's this is gonna work now? You're just gonna order me around all the time?",1
9269,Pretty much.,0
9270,All right.,0
9271,Hey Monica!,1
9272,Hi!,1
9273,"Hey man, you feeling any better?",0
9274,"Joey, we have something to tell you.",0
9275,Oh my God! You're pregnant!,2
9276,"Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, you're only married in Vegas.",0
9277,What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas you're married everywhere.,0
9278,Really?!,2
9279,Yeah!,0
9280,Oh my God!....Eh! Well,2
9281,"You see that guy? He's in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave he's going straight to the porn.",5

9288,"Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.",3
9289,We will.,0
9290,"Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.",0
9291,"No Mon,",0
9292,Every year.,0

9305,"Dude, you didn't say",0
9306,"Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.",0
9307,"Well, John McClane had plans!",3
9308,"No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.",0
9309,What are you talking about? Bitch.,3
9310,I know you botched that operation on purpose.,1
9311,"I can't prove    it yet, but when I do, you'll be going to jail for murder.",3
9312,I don't care if you    are my brother.,5
9313,"Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium    in the Devonian era was top notch!",1
9314,Stop going through my stuff !,3
9315,Hey!,1
9316,Hey!,1
9317,"I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna    do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey.",3
9318,"No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea.",6
9319,"Please, what about you and Chandler?",3
9320,That's different! I was drunk and stupid!,3
9321,Well hello !,3
9322,What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from?    Why don't you just kiss one of them?,0
9323,"I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!",3
9324,Alright . I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.,0
9325,I'm gonna do it.,1
9326,And I can't stop you.,0
9327,No.,0
9328,"Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere?",0
9329,I'm smarter than,0
9330,"Oh, hey, Gunther, check this out.",1
9331,"Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up.",1
9332,"Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, ‘cause I'm heading up there.",0
9333,"Uh, yeah, I'll take a coffee. Thanks, man.",0
9334,Sure.  Coffee? ‘Cause I'm going up there.,1
9335,No.,0
9336,"No, thank you.",0
9337,"You guys need anything, ‘cause I'm heading up there.",0
9338,I'd love an ice water.,0
9339,You got it.,0
9340,"Joey, what are you doing?",2
9341,Just being friendly.,3
9342,"Joey, honey, I don't think you're supposed to go back there.",3
9343,"Nah, it's okay. Right, Gunther?",0
9344,Don't wink at me. And put on your apron.,3
9345,"Okay, but I don't see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.",4
9346,"Joey, do you work here?",2
9347,No.,0
9348,"Hey, waiter.",0
9349,Yeah?,0
9350,"You've reached Monica and Chandler's, if you're listening to this message, we're probably screening.  Yeah we are.",0
9351,"Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum.",0
9352,I'm calling for Monica Geller.,0
9353,"I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she's still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available",0
9354,"This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!  Yes, the groom....No! Not the groom!!",2
9355,Thank you.,0
9356,Thanks.,0
9357,I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!,3
9358,Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler.  I am,0
9359,"This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again.",4
9360,So go fix it!,0
9361,Go find Chandler!,0
9362,He's probably up in your room!,4
9363,Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.,3
9364,Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you!,1
9365,"Sure!   Yeah! Las Vegas, number one!",1

9368,Hmm.,0
9369,Do you remember where the duck food is?,0
9370,"Yeah, it's in the guys' apartment under the sink. Why?",2
9371,Because I'm going to London.,0
9372,What?! What do you mean you're going to London?,2
9373,"Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him.",0
9374,"Now honey, you take care, you don't have those babies until I get back.",0
9375,"I....Rachel, you can't go! Ross loves Emily!",6
9376,"Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does.",6
9377,But I have to tell him how I feel!,4
9378,He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.,0
9379,That's not why you're going!,4
9380,"You're going because you hope he's gonna say, ""Yeah, I love you too, Rach.",4
9381,"Forget that British chippy.""",4
9382,Ohh....Do you think he will?!,2
9383,No!,4
9384,Because he's in love with the British chippy!,4
9385,"Look, Rachel, if you go, you're just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding!",3
9386,"Y'know, it's too late!",3
9387,You missed you're chance!,4
9388,"I'm sorry, I know this must be really hard, it's over.",4
9389,"Y'know what? No. It's not over until someone says, ""I do.""",3
9390,"I do! I do! I do!  I do!  Ugh, like I can really chase you. I'm carrying a litter.",1
9391,So is everybody here?,0
9392,I got here a little early myself.,0

9394,"Now, the hydrosaurids have been unearthed in two main locations.",0
9395,Here.,0
9396,Here.,0
9397,Now as for the hydrosaurs,0
9398,"Well, so anyway Beth, what I'm saying is I should've considered your feelings before I went home with you that night.",0
9399,"I've ah, I've recently learned what's it like to be on your side of it, and I'm sorry.",4
9400,"So, do you think you can forgive me?",4
9401,Great.,1
9402,Thanks.,1
9403,"Okay, bye.",0
9404,"Hello, Jennifer?",0
9405,"Oh hi, Mrs. Loreo, is Jennifer there?",2
9406,"Oh, she's not home huh?",2
9407,"Well ah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.",0
9408,Hey!,3
9409,Hi.,0
9410,Are you all right?,0
9411,Uhh… I think I just got engaged.,6
9412,Oh my God! He did it?,2
9413,Well…did you know he was gonna ask me?,1
9414,Are you kidding?,2
9415,I'm like the one who talked him into it.,1
9416,I  like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.,4
9417,And you really think this is a good idea?,4
9418,"I just talked him into it, don't tell me I have to do you too.  The puppet master gets tired people.",0
9419,I just don't know! It just doesn't feel right.,4
9420,"Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks  so.",2
9421,Really?! Even Ross?,2
9422,Especially Ross!,1
9423,"Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh y'know what? I'll-I'll come  back later.",0
9424,"Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. I'll guess just…I'll  come back.",2
9425,"There he goes, your fiancée.",1
9426,I guess so.,0
9427,Although he does play with himself in his sleep.,0
9428,I can't say that I'm surprised.,0
9429,"Oh, that is so unfortunate.",4
9430,What?,0
9431,Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.,1
9432,"Okay, I'll be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe I'm sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone.",0
9433,You didn't leave lipstick marks on the phone.,0
9434,"Oh, then it must've been you. Bye.",0
9435,Bye-bye!  That's why I moved out.,1
9436,"Hey, y'know while we're on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you don't live here anymore.",0
9437,I think on some levels she already knows.,0
9438,Night Mon. Night Julio.,0
9438,Adiós.,0
9440,"Look Julio, someone left their book here.",2
9441,"Ah actually, that is mine.",0
9442,"Oh yeah, what are you reading?",0
9443,"Flowers of Evil, by Beaudalire. Have you read it?",0
9444,"Have I read it?  No, are you enjoying it?",0
9445,"I thought I would, but the translation's no good.",0
9446,Your a poet and don't know it.,0
9447,"Actually I ah, I am a poet.",0
9448,"Oh, then you do know it.  So um what kind of things do you write about?",0
9449,"Things that move me. The, the shadow of a tree, a child laughing, or this lip.",0
9450,Mine?  Right here?,0
9451,I can write an epic poem about this lip.,1
9452,"How would that go?  Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it.",1
9453,"Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal.",0
9454,What?,2
9455,"I made a bet with myself that you have beautiful eyes. Now that I see them, I win.",0
9456,What?,2
9457,We're at my stop. But would you like to have coffee?,0
9458,Are we really in Montreal?!,2
9459,"Yes we are. So, coffee?",0
9460,"Coffee sounds great.  Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?",0
9461,"Oh, no. But it's just a two hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia.",0
9462,"Okay, here's batch 22.",0
9463,"Oh, maybe these'll taste a little like your grandmother's.",3
9464,"This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.",0
9465,Let's give it a shot.,0
9467,"Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?",2
9468,"No, just a Friday night.",0
9469,Would she?,0
9470,Would she?  You ate my candy bar!,3

9872,Oh hey Joey! What's up?,1
9873,"I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right?",0
9874,"Yeah, I've been around.",0
9875,"Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?",0
9876,"Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees.",0
9879,Great! Problem solved!,1
9880,"Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.",4
9881,"All right, first thing we gotta do, damage control.",0
9882,Why?,2
9883,"Well, I think uhh, someone out there may have been bad mouthing you all over town.",4
9884,Bastard!,3
9885,You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping or....Oh!,2
9886,All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp!,2
9887,"Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it.",1
9889,"Oh, I can't believe it!",2
9890,I mean I think it's great!,1
9891,For him.,0
9892,She might be able to do better.,0
9893,Hey guys!,0
9894,Joey! Come here! Come here!,0
9896,Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.,0
9897,You mean how they're friends and nothing more?,0
9898,"No. Joey, she",0
9899,"Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?",2
9900,"Yes, but y'know what?",0
9901,It doesn't matter who knows what.,0
9902,"Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know!",0
9903,Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!,1
9904,"It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.",0
9905,"Y'know, you're friend's getting married, it's gotta change things.",0
9906,You really think it would be that different?,2
9907,How could it not be?,2
9908,"I mean pretty soon they're gonna be having kids, and then they're just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids.",4
9909,And then maybe they're gonna have to leave the city to be near a,4
9910,"Well, things change.",0
9911,I don't want them to move to a,4
9912,It'll be okay Joe.,0
9913,Its still there!,2
9914,Mrs. Braverman must be out.,0
9915,She could be out of town. Maybe she'll be gone for months.,4
9916,"By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don't want her to come back to bad cheesecake.",6
9917,No that could kill her.,6
9918,"Well, we don't want that.",0
9919,"No, so we're protecting her.",0
9920,But we should take it.,0
9921,But we should move quick.,6
9922,Why?,2
9923,Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.,6
9924,Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!,6
9925,"Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?",0
9926,Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.,0
9927,"Well, you're gonna.",0
9928,"I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...",0
9929,"Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?",0
9930,"Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women.",0
9931,"And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know?",4
9932,"Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...",0
9933,"Hey, you're not him.",0
9934,You're you.,0
9935,"When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?",0
9936,No.,0
9937,No.,0
9938,You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business.,0
9939,"Now that wasn't easy, but you did it!",0
9940,"And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say ""No thanks, I'm married.""",0
9941,You really think so?,1
9942,Yeah. I really do.,0
9943,"Thanks, Chandler.",0
9944,Get off!,3
9945,Hi.,0
9946,"Your Fettuccini Alfredo looks a little dry, did you use all your cheese?",0
9947,"When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?",0
9948,And the cream?,0
9949,Cheese makes me thirsty.,0
9950,Okay. Let's move on.,0
9951,All right.,0
9952,Oh! Something smells good over at Monica's station!  Oh my God! This is absolutely amazing! You've never made this before?,2
9953,Oh no!,2
9954,I don't know anything about cooking.,0
9955,"I had to ask someone what it's called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles.",0
9956,"Well, hats off to the chef.",1
9957,"I-I-I'm sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didn't hear what you said. Umm, hats off to who now?",0
9958,The chef!,1
9959,That's right.,1
9960,"Hey, Pheebs.",0
9961,Hey.,0
9962,How's it going?,0
9963,Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.,1
9964,So what's going on?,0
9965,"Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger.",0
9966,"I dunno, there's just something about...",0
9967,Basically we just feel that he's...,0
9968,We hate that guy.,5
9969,Yeah. Hate him.,5
9970,"We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.",4
9971,Uh-huh.,0
9972,Okay.,0
9973,"Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?",0
9974,"...No, we hate him.",5
9975,We're sorry.,4
9976,Hey!,1
9977,Hey!,1
9978,What are you doing?,0
9979,I'm sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.,0
9980,Yes that was mine.,6
9981,Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.,0
9982,Yes that would have made more sense.,4
9983,"Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man!",3
9984,"All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time.",0
9985,"And whatever you say, I'll believe ya.",0
9986,"Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?",3
9988,"Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?",3
9989,"Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.",0
9990,She said what?,2
9991,"She said, ""If I'm not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it.""",0
9992,Postpone it?,1
9993,"Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding?",3
9994,"Do you my sister's teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh?",3
9995,This isn't right.,0
9996,"I realize that people are going to be disappointed. But, I'm sure they'll come back when we can do it right.",4
9997,I can't ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?,3
9998,Don't you point your pants at me!,3
9999,We have no choice!,3
10000,"Anywhere that's half-decent would've be booked months ago, Ross don't you understand?",3
10001,This is our wedding I'm talking about.,3
10002,The only thing I understand is postponing it is not an option. This is when we're getting married.,0
10003,So what are you saying? It's now or never?,3
10004,No. I'm saying it's now.,0
10005,Or?,3
10006,There's no ‘or' in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!,3
10007,It's not the pants.,3
10008,It's you that is backwards.,3
10009,"And if, and if you don't understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldn't get married at all!",3
10010,"No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please....",4
10011,"Hi, honey.",0
10012,See you later.,0
10013,"What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!",1
10014,Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask!,3
10015,"Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. I'm calling for Monica Geller.",0
10016,Oh no!,2
10017,"I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she's still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available",0
10018,"Oh please, he didn't hear it! He didn't hear it!!",6
10019,This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!,2
10020,NOOOO!!!!!!!!,3
10021,Ma! What're you doing here?,2
10022,I came to give you this  and this.,0
10023,Oww! Big ring!,2

10025,"Do you uh, do you talk about me?",0
10026,"Yeah, yeah, all the time.",0
10027,Really?,2
10028,"But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.",0
10029,Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!,5
10030,Have you ever seen so much crap?,5
10031,"Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap",3
10032,Check this out. Can I have this?,0
10033,What?,0
10034,"I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti.",0
10035,"All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office.",0
10036,"It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.",1
10037,"If it's not you, this is a horrible story.",4
10038,"Fortunately, it is me.",1
10039,"And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much.",1
10040,"Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate.",1
10041,"Y'know, someplace nice.",0
10042,"Yeah, someplace nice.",0
10043,Yeah!,1
10044,How much do you think I can get for my kidney?,0
10045,"So, what do you think?",0
10046,I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.,1
10047,I know!,1
10048,"So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?",0
10049,"Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!",1
10050,Heads up Ross!  Score!  You suck!,1
10052,Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.,0
10053,Gotcha.,0
10054,This place is really my Grandmother's.,0
10055,"I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this.",0
10056,"So if the landlord ever asks, I'm 87 year old woman, who's afraid of her VCR.",0
10057,So are you thirsty?,0
10058,"Oh, you bet I am!",1
10059,"Okay, here's your penis!",2
10064,"Ohh, okay.",0

10072,Enh. Sure!,0
10073,I wonder how long that milk  has been setting out.,5
10074,"Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy!",0
10075,That....this milk is mine.,0
10076,"I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know.",0

10078,"Hey, buddy!  Are you familiar with Section 11-B of the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the",3
10079,But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place.,0
10080,"Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health?!",5
10081,"Okay, stop!",3
10082,"Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy?",0
10083,"Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?",3
10084,"Well, I suppose I could give him a warning.",0
10085,Thank you.,1

10110,Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin....  swans.,4
10111,That word was swans.,0
10112,What do we got there?,2
10113,"A piece of something: boxer shorts, greeting cards, and what looks like a half-charred picture....Wow, that guy's hairier than the Chief!",2
10114,"You know, it's a really funny story how this happened.",1

10217,"No, Rachel doesn't want me to....",3
10218,"Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you ‘cause she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but don't punish your friends for what Rachel did to you.",0
