223,This is all your fault.,3
224,"This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know?",3
225,"My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you.",3
226,The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this just as much as you have.,3
227,"No no no, believe me.",3
228,"No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok?",3

278,"Oh my God! I don't believe it! Oh, you poor bunny.",2
279,I'm an idiot.,5

373,We weren't but we had one class together. He was such a great    guy and he talked so passionately about science. I always remembered him.,4
374,I'm sure that would mean a lot to him.,0
375,"And if heaven has a    door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.",0
376,I thought so many times about calling him and asking him out.    I guess I really missed my chance.,4

392,If you're anxious there are a few ways to help things along.,0

441,"Dude, you don't have to brag! We got nothing here!!",3

443,"We could, or we can have sex in it.",1
444,"Well let me think about that, while I remove my pants!",1
445,I thought I was a complete idiot.,2

450,What? I…I just figured since you're pregnant you're not gonna be seeing people.,2
451,"Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people. Second of all, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant?",3
452,I didn't tell him. I didn't know if you were telling people. This is back when I thought Kash was still people.,0
453,"Good-good, don't tell him. Don't tell him. Just have him call me okay?",6
454,"Rach look, I really don't think that's such a great",4
455,"Okay, you go do it! I'll come back to that set! I'll meet more actors! I'll meet ‘em all!",1

486,"No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms.",0
487,"Well, they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is ‘no tissue, no tuschy.'  Well, if everybody's going.",0
488,"No, y'know what don't close it  ‘cause the... keys...are in there.",0

497,"What?  So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler?",2
498,"Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not.",0
499,"Joey, you can't keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him.",0
500,"It'll kill him. I mean it'll, it'll just kill him.",6
501,"Well, you could wait ‘til I go to the dentist, maybe",0
504,"Hey, what are you doing here?",0
505,"Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of",0

608,"I got a call at two in the morning, but all I could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum.",0

647,"Yeah. Ooh, and I know Gail Rosten is in there twice, but she is so",0
648,"Oh, I know.  Y'know, just-just talking about it is getting me kinda",0
649,"Oh, me too.",0
650,"and then, we could've gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar!",1
651,"Ross, it just wouldn't have been feasible.",0
652,But having a dove place the ring on your finger would've been no problem?,3
653,It was really fun being married to you tonight.,1
654,"Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks I've ever made.",1
655,"Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?",4

661,It was…really wonderful!,1
662,Did you just make that up?,2
663,"No, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out.",0
664,"It's how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me.",0
665,"Well, that would've been very hard to say no too.",0
666,"It's a good thing I didn't do it, because it sounds like it would've been a very expensive wedding.  Okay, good night",0
667,Goodnight,0
668,Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn't get messed up?,0
669,I will think about it.,0
670,That's all I'm askin',0

685,"Although, I might need some convincing.",0
686,"Well, I, umm",6
687,"Kidding! God, I feel wild today!",1
688,Oh my God! Chandler just left though!,2
689,"Yeah but, maybe it's not what we think. Maybe it's tell Monica I'm sorry I…drank the last of the milk.",0
690,"Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he's changed his name, y'know? Tell Monica I'm sorry.",0
691,I think it means he freaked out and left!,2
692,Don't be so negative! Good God! Isn't it possible that Sorry is sitting in there  right now?!,3
693,"Okay. Phoebe, I-I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do?",4

741,"Um, I'm not.",0
742,"Oh, god, I knew it, that I freaked you out.",4

1012,"Y'know, if they knew what they were doing they probably didn't give you real names either.",0
1013,"Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they don't give out fake names.",3

1038,And is this in case the house sneezes?,2
1039,"No, no, that's the ghost for the attic.",0
1040,I don't want a ghost.,6
1041,"Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you've got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.",0
1042,"Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen.",2
1043,"Okay, obviously you don't know much about the U.S. government.",0
